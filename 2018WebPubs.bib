abstract = {Dense hard-particle packings are intimately related to the structure of low-temperature phases of matter and are useful models of heterogeneous materials and granular media. Most studies of the densest packings in three dimensions have considered spherical shapes, and it is only more recently that nonspherical shapes (e.g., ellipsoids) have been investigated. Superballs (whose shapes are defined by parallel to x(1)parallel to(2p)+parallel to x(2)parallel to(2p)+parallel to x(3)parallel to(2p){\textless}= 1) provide a versatile family of convex particles (p {\textgreater}= 0.5) with both cubic-like and octahedral-like shapes as well as concave particles (0 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.5) with octahedral-like shapes. In this paper, we provide analytical constructions for the densest known superball packings for all convex and concave cases. The candidate maximally dense packings are certain families of Bravais lattice packings (in which each particle has 12 contacting neighbors) possessing the global symmetries that are consistent with certain symmetries of a superball. We also provide strong evidence that our packings for convex superballs (p {\textgreater}= 0.5) are most likely the optimal ones. The maximal packing density as a function of p is nonanalytic at the sphere point (p=1) and increases dramatically as p moves away from unity. Two more nontrivial nonanalytic behaviors occur at p(c)({\{}*{\}})=1.150 9... and p(o)({\{}*{\}})=ln 3/ln 4=0.792 4... for ``cubic{\{}''{\}} and ``octahedral{\{}''{\}} superballs, respectively, where different Bravais lattice packings possess the same densities. The packing characteristics determined by the broken rotational symmetry of superballs are similar to but richer than their two-dimensional ``superdisk{\{}''{\}} counterparts {\{}[{\}}Y. Jiao , Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 245504 (2008)] and are distinctly different from that of ellipsoid packings. Our candidate optimal superball packings provide a starting point to quantify the equilibrium phase behavior of superball systems, which should deepen our understanding of the statistical thermodynamics of nonspherical-particle systems.},

abstract = {Packing problems are ubiquitous(1,2), ranging from oil extraction
through porous rocks to grain storage in silos and the compaction of
pharmaceutical powders into tablets. At a given density, particulate
systems pack into a mechanically stable and amorphous jammed state(3,4).
Previous theoretical studies have explored a connection between this
jammed state and the glass transition(4-8), the thermodynamics of
jamming(9-12) and geometric modelling of random packings(13-15).
Nevertheless, a simple underlying mechanism for the random assembly of
athermal particles, analogous to crystalline ordering, remains unknown.
Here we use three-dimensional measurements of packings of polydisperse
emulsion droplets to build a simple statistical model in which the
complexity of the global packing is distilled into a local stochastic
process. From the perspective of a single particle, the packing problem
is reduced to the random formation of nearest neighbours, followed by a
choice of contacts among them. The two key parameters in the model-the
available space around a particle and the ratio of contacts to
neighbours-are directly obtained from experiments. We demonstrate that
this `granocentric' view captures the properties of the polydisperse
emulsion packing-ranging from the microscopic distributions of nearest
neighbours and contacts, to local density fluctuations, to the global
packing density. Application of our results to monodisperse and
bidisperse systems produces quantitative agreement with previously
measured trends in global density(16). Our model therefore reveals a
general principle of organization for random packing and may provide the
foundations for a theory of jammed matter.},

abstract = {Mechanical equilibrium at zero temperature does not necessarily imply thermodynamic equilibrium at finite temperature for a particle confined by a static but nonconservative force field. Instead, the diffusing particle can enter into a steady state characterized by toroidal circulation in the probability flux, which we call a Brownian vortex. The circulatory bias in the particle's thermally driven trajectory is not simply a deterministic response to the solenoidal component of the force but rather reflects interplay between advection and diffusion in which thermal fluctuations extract work from the nonconservative force field. As an example of this previously unrecognized class of stochastic heat engines, we consider a colloidal sphere diffusing in a conventional optical tweezer. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that nonconservative optical forces bias the particle's fluctuations into toroidal vortexes whose circulation can reverse direction with temperature or laser power.},

Using the g(2)-invariant optimization method of Torquato and Stillinger {\{}[{\}}J. Phys. Chem. B 106, 8354 (2002)], parameters in these functions are optimized under necessary realizability conditions to maximize the packing fraction phi and average number of contacts per sphere Z. A pair correlation function that incorporates the salient features of a disordered packing and that is smooth beyond contact is shown to permit a phi of 0.6850: this value represents a 45{\%} reduction in the difference between the maximum for congruent hard spheres in three dimensions, pi/18 approximate to 0.7405 and 0.64, the approximate fraction associated with maximally random jammed packings in three dimensions. We show that, surprisingly, the continued addition of elementary functions consisting of smooth sinusoids decaying as r(-4) permits packing fractions approaching pi/18. A translational order metric is used to discriminate between degrees of order in the packings presented. We find that to achieve higher packing fractions, the degree of order must increase, which is consistent with the results of a previous study {\{}[{\}}Torquato , Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2064 (2000)].},

of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter(1-4), granular
media(3,5), heterogeneous materials(3) and biological systems(6-8).
Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest
packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number
theory(9-11). Previous work has focused mainly on spherical
particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we
formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an
optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to
periodic boundary conditions (we term this the `adaptive shrinking cell'
scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we
find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids
(the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in
three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947...,
0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral
packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest
packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are
their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our
simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical
arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the
Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their
corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's
sphere conjecture for these solids.},

abstract = {Glycine nanocrystals, grown in aligned nanometer-scale cylindrical pores
of nanoporous polystyrene-poly(dimethyl acrylamide) monoliths by
evaporation of imbibed aqueous solutions, adopt preferred orientations
with their fast-growth axes aligned parallel with the pore direction.
X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the exclusive formation of the
metastable beta-polymorph, with crystal size comparable with the 22 nm
pore diameter, in contrast to the formation of alpha-glycine in the
absence of nanoscale confinement. When grown from aqueous solutions
alone, the nanocrystals were oriented with their {\{}[{\}}010] and {\{}[{\}}0 (1)

enantiomorphs of beta-glycine, respectively, aligned parallel with the
pore direction. In contrast, crystallization in the presence of racemic
mixtures of chiral auxiliaries known to inhibit growth along the {\{}[{\}}010]
and {\{}[{\}}0 (1) over bar0] directions of the enantiomorphs produced
beta-glycine nanocrystals with their {\{}[{\}}001] axes nearly parallel to the
pore direction. Enantiopure auxiliaries that inhibit crystallization
along the native fast growth direction of only one of the enantiomorphs
allow the other enantiomorph to grow with the {\{}[{\}}010] axis parallel to
the cylinder. Collectively, these results demonstrate that crystal
growth occurs such that the fast-growing direction, which can be altered
by adding chiral auxiliaries, is parallel to the pore direction. This
behavior can be attributed to a competition between differently aligned
crystals due to critical size effects, the minimization of the surface
energy of specific crystal planes, and a more effective reduction of the
excess free energy associated with supersaturated conditions when the
crystal grows with its fast-growth axis unimpeded by pore walls. These
observations suggest that the beta-glycine nanocrystals form by
homogeneous nucleation, with minimal influence of the pore walls on
orientation.},

Surprisingly, the ability of single-stranded DNA to form folded
secondary structures has not been explored for controlling (nano)

nanotechnology(12-14). Here, we show how loop and hairpin formation in
the DNA coatings of micrometre-sized particles gives us in situ control
over the inter-particle binding strength and association kinetics. We
can finely tune and even switch off the attractions between particles,
rendering them inert unless they are heated or held together-like a
nano-contact glue. The novel kinetic control offered by the switchable
self-protected attractions is explained with a simple quantitative model
that emphasizes the competition between intra- and inter-particle
hybridization, and the practical utility is demonstrated by the assembly
of designer clusters in concentrated suspensions. With self-protection,
both the suspension and assembly product are stable, whereas
conventional attractive colloids would quickly aggregate. This
remarkable functionality makes our self-protected colloids a novel

largely unexplored. Nanocrystals of pimelic acid,

size-dependent polymorphism and thermotropic behavior because of the

monotonically with decreasing pore size, and the enantiotropic phase
behavior of bulk glutaric acid and suberic acid switches to monotropic
when confined within the nanoscale pores of CPG and p-PCHE.
Collectively, these results reveal that nanometer-scale size confinement
can alter crystallization outcomes and affect polymorph stability

small pores can lead to the discovery of new polymorphs that otherwise

relevant to the realizability of pair correlation functions for packings

biomaterials that have gained significant attention in recent years due
to their potential applications in biotechnology, electronics and

supramolecular structures. Recently, we developed block polymers
consisting of two distinct SADs derived from an elastin-mimetic

polymers, synthesized as the block sequences-EC, CE, and ECE-were
assessed for overall conformation and macroscopic thermoresponsive

the small molecule binding and release profile of these block polymers.
Our results demonstrate that the protein polymers assemble into
particles as well as fully or partially networked structures in a
concentration dependent manner that is distinct from the individual E

synthetic block polymers, the structured assembly, binding and release
abilities are highly dependent on the composition and orientation of the

abstract = {Dense random packings of hard particles are useful models of granular
media and are closely related to the structure of nonequilibrium
low-temperature amorphous phases of matter. Most work has been done for
random jammed packings of spheres and it is only recently that
corresponding packings of nonspherical particles (e.g., ellipsoids) have
received attention. Here we report a study of the maximally random
jammed (MRJ) packings of binary superdisks and monodispersed superballs
whose shapes are defined by vertical bar x(1)vertical bar(2p) + ... +
vertical bar x(d)vertical bar(2p) {\textless}= 1 with d = 2 and 3, respectively,
where p is the deformation parameter with values in the interval (0,
infinity). As p increases from zero, one can get a family of both
concave (0 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.5) and convex (p {\textgreater}= 0.5) particles with square
symmetry (d = 2), or octahedral and cubic symmetry (d = 3). In
particular, for p = 1 the particle is a perfect sphere (circular disk)
and for p -{\textgreater} infinity the particle is a perfect cube (square). We find
that the MRJ densities of such packings increase dramatically and
nonanalytically as one moves away from the circular-disk and sphere
point (p = 1). Moreover, the disordered packings are hypostatic, i.e.,
the average number of contacting neighbors is less than twice the total
number of degrees of freedom per particle, and yet the packings are
mechanically stable. As a result, the local arrangements of particles
are necessarily nontrivially correlated to achieve jamming. We term such
correlated structures ``nongeneric.{\{}''{\}} The degree of
``nongenericity{\{}''{\}} of the packings is quantitatively characterized by
determining the fraction of local coordination structures in which the
central particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average. We also
show that such seemingly ``special{\{}''{\}} packing configurations are
counterintuitively not rare. As the anisotropy of the particles
increases, the fraction of rattlers decreases while the minimal
orientational order as measured by the tetratic and cubatic order
parameters increases. These characteristics result from the unique
manner in which superballs break their rotational symmetry, which also
makes the superdisk and superball packings distinctly different from
other known nonspherical hard-particle packings.},

Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 80, 041104 (2009)]. Because the objective function and impenetrability constraints can be exactly linearized for sphere packings with a size distribution in d-dimensional Euclidean space R(d), it is most suitable and natural to solve the corresponding ASC optimization problem using sequential-linear-programming (SLP) techniques. We implement an SLP solution to produce robustly a wide spectrum of jammed sphere packings in R(d) for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with a diversity of disorder and densities up to the respective maximal densities. A novel feature of this deterministic algorithm is that it can produce a broad range of inherent structures (locally maximally dense and mechanically stable packings), besides the usual disordered ones (such as the maximally random jammed state), with very small computational cost compared to that of the best known packing algorithms by tuning the radius of the influence sphere. For example, in three dimensions, we show that it can produce with high probability a variety of strictly jammed packings with a packing density anywhere in the wide range {\{}[{\}}0.6, 0.7408.], where pi/root 18= 0.7408... corresponds to the density of the densest packing. We also apply the algorithm to generate various disordered packings as well as the maximally dense packings for d = 2, 4, 5, and 6. Our jammed sphere packings are characterized and compared to the corresponding packings generated by the well-known Lubachevsky-Stillinger (LS) molecular-dynamics packing algorithm. Compared to the LS procedure, our SLP protocol is able to ensure that the final packings are truly jammed, produces disordered jammed packings with anomalously low densities, and is appreciably more robust and computationally faster at generating maximally dense packings, especially as the space dimension increases.},

ends is increasingly used for guiding the self-assembly of nano- and
micrometer-sized particles into larger scale ordered structures Here we
present measurements, formulas, and graphs that allow one to
quantitatively predict the association behavior of DNA-coated particles
from readily available Web-based data From experiments it appears that
the suspension behavior is very sensitive to the grafting details, such
as the length and flexibility of the tether constructs and the
particles' surface coverage. Thus, if one wants to control the
interactions and assembly processes, insight is needed into the
structural and dynamical features of the DNA coatings We demonstrate how
a straightforward measurement of the particles' association-dissociation
kinetics during selected temperature cycles, combined with a simple
quantitative model, can reveal the relevant properties. We used this
method in a systematic study where we varied the temperature cycle, the
bead concentration, the particles' surface coverage, and the DNA
construct. Among other things, we find that the backbone that tethers
the sticky ends to the surface can have a significant impact on the
particles' dissociation properties, as it affects the total number of
interparticle bonds and the configurational entropy cost associated with
these bonds We further find that, independent of the tether backbone,
self-complementary ``palindromic{\{}''{\}} sticky ends readily form
intraparticle hairpins and loops, which greatly affect the particles'
association behavior. Such secondary structure formation is increasingly
important in faster temperature quenches, at lower particle
concentration, and at lower surface coverage. The latter observations
are especially useful for the design of so-called self-protected
DNA-mediated interactions, which we pioneered recently and for which we
expect to find an increasing use, as they enable more versatile assembly

considering the ``granocentric'' point of view of a single particle in

neighbours, followed by a random choice of contacts among them. The
model is based on only two parameters, the available solid angle around
each particle and the ratio of contacts to neighbors, which are both
directly obtainable from experiments or simulations. As a result, the
model analytically predicts the microscopic distributions of nearest
neighbours and contacts, the local density fluctuations as well as the
global density of the packing. We find that this granocentric view
captures the essential properties of the polydisperse emulsion packing.
This model suggests a general principle of organization for random

Introducing heptagons and pentagons (defects with topological charge)
makes it easier to tile curved surfaces; for example, soccer balls based
on the geodesic domes(1) of Buckminster Fuller have exactly 12 pentagons
(positive charges). Interacting particles that invariably form hexagonal
crystals on a plane exhibit fascinating scarred defect patterns on a
sphere(2-4). Here we show that, for more general curved surfaces,
curvature may be relaxed by pleats: uncharged lines of dislocations
(topological dipoles) that vanish on the surface and play the same role
as fabric pleats. We experimentally investigate crystal order on
surfaces with spatially varying positive and negative curvature. On
cylindrical capillary bridges, stretched to produce negative curvature,
we observe a sequence of transitions-consistent with our energetic
calculations-from no defects to isolated dislocations, which
subsequently proliferate and organize into pleats; finally, scars and
isolated heptagons (previously unseen) appear. This fine control of
crystal order with curvature will enable explorations of general
theories of defects in curved spaces(5-11). From a practical viewpoint,
it may be possible to engineer structures with curvature (such as
waisted nanotubes and vaulted architecture) and to develop novel methods

abstract = {Understanding the characteristics of jammed particle packings provides
basic insights into the structure and bulk properties of crystals,
glasses, and granular media, and into selected aspects of biological
systems. This review describes the diversity of jammed configurations
attainable by frictionless convex nonoverlapping (hard) particles in
Euclidean spaces and for that purpose it stresses individual-packing
geometric analysis. A fundamental feature of that diversity is the
necessity to classify individual jammed configurations according to
whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly jammed. Each of
these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations spanning
a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive
properties, including packing fraction phi, mean contact number Z, and
several scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to
spheres in three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model)
covers a myriad of jammed states, including maximally dense packings (as
Kepler conjectured), lowdensity strictly-jammed tunneled crystals, and a
substantial family of amorphous packings. With respect to the last of
these, the current approach displaces the historically prominent but
ambiguous idea of ``random close packing{\{}''{\}} (RCP) with the precise
concept of ``maximally random jamming{\{}''{\}} (MRJ). Both laboratory
procedures and numerical simulation protocols can, and frequently have
been, used for creation of ensembles of jammed states. But while the
resulting distributions of intensive properties may individually
approach narrow distributions in the large system limit, the
distinguishing varieties of possible operational details in these
procedures and protocols lead to substantial variability among the
resulting distributions, some examples of which are presented here. This
review also covers recent advances in understanding jammed packings of
polydisperse sphere mixtures, as well as convex nonspherical particles,
e.g., ellipsoids, ``superballs{\{}''{\}}, and polyhedra. Because of their
relevance to error-correcting codes and information theory, sphere
packings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as
well. We also make some remarks about packings in (curved) non-Euclidean
spaces. In closing this review, several basic open questions for future
research to consider have been identified.},

abstract = {Icosahedrite, ideally Al63Cu24Fe13, is a new mineral from the Khatyrka
River, southeastern Chukhotka, Russia. It occurs as dark gray-black
anhedral to subhedral grains up to 100 mu m across, closely associated
with spine!, diopside, forsterite, nepheline, sodalite, corundum,
stishovite, khatyrkite, cupalite, and an unnamed phase of composition
AlCuFe. Icosahedrite is opaque with a metallic luster, possesses a gray
streak, and is brittle with an uneven fracture. The density could not be
determined. For quasicrystals, by definition, the structure is not
reducible to a single three-dimensional unit cell, so neither cell
parameters nor Z can be given. In plane-polarized incident light,
icosahedrite exhibits neither bireflectance nor pleochroism. Between
crossed polars, it is isotropic. Reflectance percentages (R-min = R-max)
for the four standard COM wavelengths are 62.3 (471.1 nm), 60.6 (548.3
nm), 58.1 (586.6 nm), and 56.0 (652.3 nm), respectively.
The X-ray powder pattern was indexed on the basis of six integer
indices, as conventionally used with quasicrystals, where the lattice
parameter (in six-dimensional notation) is measured to be a(6D) = 12.64
angstrom, with probable space group Fm (3) over bar (5) over bar. The
four strongest X-ray powder-diffraction lines {\{}[{\}}d in angstrom
(I/I-0)(n(1),n(2),n(3),n(4),n(5),n(6))] are: 2.006 (100) (4 (2) over

(4) over bar 064), and 3.41 (25) (31 (1) over bar (1) over bar 11).
Average results of 34 electron-microprobe analyses gave, on the basis of
total atoms = 100, the formula
Al63.11Cu24.02Fe12.78Si0.03Co0.01Ca0.01Zn0.01Cr0.02Cl0.01. The
simplified formula is Al63Cu24Fe13, which requires the mass fractions Al
43.02, Cu 38.60, Fe 18.38, total 100.00 wt{\%}.

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce constructions of the high-dimensional generalizations of the kagome and diamond crystals. The two-dimensional kagome crystal and its three-dimensional counterpart, the pyrochlore crystal, have been extensively studied in the context of geometric frustration in antiferromagnetic materials. Similarly, the polymorphs of elemental carbon include the diamond crystal and the corresponding two-dimensional honeycomb structure, adopted by graphene. The kagome crystal in d Euclidean dimensions consists of vertex-sharing d-dimensional simplices in which all of the points are topologically equivalent. The d-dimensional generalization of the diamond crystal can then be obtained from the centroids of each of the simplices, and we show that this natural construction of the diamond crystal is distinct from the D(d)(+) family of crystals for all dimensions d not equal 3. We analyze the structural properties of these high-dimensional crystals, including the packing densities, coordination numbers, void exclusion probability functions, covering radii and quantizer errors. Our results demonstrate that the so-called decorrelation principle, which formally states that unconstrained correlations vanish in asymptotically high dimensions, remarkably applies to the case of periodic point patterns with inherent long-range order. We argue that the decorrelation principle is already exhibited in periodic crystals in low dimensions via a `smoothed' pair correlation function obtained by convolution with a Gaussian kernel. These observations support the universality of the decorrelation principle for any point pattern in high dimensions, whether disordered or not. This universal property in turn suggests that the best conjectural lower bound on the maximal sphere-packing density in high Euclidean dimensions derived by Torquato and Stillinger (2006 Expt. Math. 15 307) is, in fact, optimal.},

abstract = {The killing efficacy of doxorubicin from liposome-based delivery
carriers has been shown to correlate strongly with its intracellular
trafficking and, in particular, its fast and extensive release from the
delivery carrier. However, previously explored pH-triggered mechanisms
that were designed to become activated during liposome endocytosis have
also been shown to interfere with the liposome stability in vivo. We
have designed pH-triggered gel-phase liposomes with heterogeneous
membranes for the delivery of doxorubicin. These liposomes are triggered
to form ``leaky{\{}''{\}} interfacial boundaries between gel-gel phase
separated domains on the membrane bilayer with lowering pH. The
pH-triggered mechanism does not compromise liposome stability in vivo
and results in superior in vitro killing efficacy of delivered
doxorubicin when liposomes are endocytosed by a clathrin-mediated
pathway. In the present work, we evaluate the general applicability of
these liposomes when targeted to the folate receptor (FR) of KB cancer
cells in vitro and become endocytosed by a less acidic pathway: the
caveolae pathway. FR-targeting liposomes exhibit almost 50{\%} decrease in
cell association for increase in liposome size from 120 to 280 nm in
diameter after relatively short incubation times (up to 4 h). The
fraction of internalized vesicles, however, is approximately 60{\%} of the
cell associated vesicles independent of their size. Our findings
demonstrate that, for the same doxorubicin uptake per cancer cell, the
killing effect of doxorubicin delivered by pH-triggered lipid vesicles
is greater (IC(50) = 0.032 mM for a 6 h incubation) than when delivered
by a conventional non-pH-responsive composition (IC(50) = 0.194 mM).
These findings suggest higher bioexposure of cells to the therapeutic
agent possibly via faster and more extensive release from the carrier.
Animal studies of FR-targeting non-pH-responsive liposomal doxorubicin
report stronger therapeutic potential for the targeted approach relative
to nontargeted liposomes and to free doxorubicin. The findings of the
present study suggest that the targeted pH-triggered liposomes could
potentially further enhance the therapeutic outcomes of doxorubicin in
vivo.},

bimolecular reactions, protein folding or allosteric conformational
changes. Nonequilibrium trajectories are readily measured
experimentally, but their statistical significance and relation to
equilibrium system properties still call for rigorous methods of
assessment and interpretation. Here we introduce methods to compute the
equilibrium free energy profile of a given variable from a set of short
nonequilibrium trajectories, obtained by externally driving a system out
of equilibrium and subsequently observing its relaxation. This protocol
is not suitable for the Jarzynski equality since the irreversible work
on the system is instantaneous. Assuming that the variable of interest
satisfies an overdamped Langevin equation, which is frequently used for
modeling biomolecular processes, we show that the trajectories sample a
nonequilibrium stationary distribution that can be calculated in closed
form. This allows for the estimation of the free energy via an inversion
procedure that is analogous to that used in equilibrium and bypasses
more complicated path integral methods, which we derive for comparison.
We generalize the inversion procedure to systems with a diffusion
constant that depends on the reaction coordinate, as is the case in
protein folding, as well as to protocols in which the trajectories are
initiated at random points. Using only a statistical pool of tens of
synthetic trajectories, we demonstrate the versatility of these methods

collocation method based on the trapezoidal rule is applied to the

translating prolate spheroids with various aspect ratios, the scheme is
used to explore the effects of the choice of completion flow on the
error in the numerical solution, as well as the condition number of the
discretized integral operator. The approach is applied to obtain the
velocity and viscous dissipation of rotating helices of circular

abstract = {DNA molecules provide what is probably the most iconic example of
self-replication-the ability of a system to replicate, or make copies
of, itself. In living cells the process is mediated by enzymes and
occurs autonomously, with the number of replicas increasing
exponentially over time without the need for external manipulation.
Self-replication has also been implemented with synthetic systems,
including RNA enzymes designed to undergo self-sustained exponential
amplification(1-5). An exciting next step would be to use
self-replication in materials fabrication, which requires robust and
general systems capable of copying and amplifying functional materials
or structures. Here we report a first development in this direction,
using DNA tile motifs that can recognize and bind complementary tiles in
a pre-programmed fashion. We first design tile motifs so they form a
seven-tile seed sequence; then use the seeds to instruct the formation
of a first generation of complementary seven-tile daughter sequences;
and finally use the daughters to instruct the formation of seven-tile
granddaughter sequences that are identical to the initial seed
sequences. Considering that DNA is a functional material that can
organize itself and other molecules into useful structures(6-13), our
findings raise the tantalizing prospect that we may one day be able to
realize self-replicating materials with various patterns or useful
functions.},

abstract = {A packing of spherical caps on the surface of a sphere (that is, a
spherical code) is called rigid or jammed if it is isolated within the
space of packings. In other words, aside from applying a global
isometry, the packing cannot be deformed. In this paper, we
systematically study the rigidity of spherical codes, particularly
kissing configurations. One surprise is that the kissing configuration
of the Coxeter-Todd lattice is not jammed, despite being locally jammed
(each individual cap is held in place if its neighbors are fixed); in
this respect, the Coxeter-Todd lattice is analogous to the face-centered
cubic lattice in three dimensions. By contrast, we find that many other
packings have jammed kissing configurations, including the Barnes-Wall
lattice and all of the best kissing configurations known in four through
twelve dimensions. Jamming seems to become much less common for large
kissing configurations in higher dimensions, and in particular it fails
for the best kissing configurations known in 2 5 through 3 1 dimensions.
Motivated by this phenomenon, we find new kissing configurations in
these dimensions, which improve on the records set in 1982 by the
laminated lattices.},

abstract = {The densest local packings of N three-dimensional identical nonoverlapping spheres within a radius R-min(N) of a fixed central sphere of the same size are obtained for selected values of N up to N = 1054. In the predecessor to this paper {\{}[{\}}A. B. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 81, 041305 (2010)], we described our method for finding the putative densest packings of N spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d and presented those packings in R-2 for values of N up to N = 348. Here we analyze the properties and characteristics of the densest local packings in R-3 and employ knowledge of the R-min(N), using methods applicable in any d, to construct both a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In R-3, we find wide variability in the densest local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare the densest local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy configurations of N + 1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and long-range attractive pair potentials, e. g., 12-6 Lennard-Jones, and find that they are in general completely different, a result that has possible implications for nucleation theory. We also compare the densest local packings to finite subsets of stacking variants of the densest infinite packings in R-3 (the Barlow packings) and find that the densest local packings are almost always most similar as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about a single central sphere, e. g., a subset of the fcc Barlow packing. Additionally, we observe that the densest local packings are dominated by the dense arrangement of spheres with centers at distance R-min(N). In particular, we find two ``maracas{\{}''{\}} packings at N = 77 and N = 93, each consisting of a few unjammed spheres free to rattle within a ``husk{\{}''{\}} composed of the maximal number of spheres that can be packed with centers at respective R-min(N).},

Specifically, we consider maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of hard ellipses and superdisks and show that these systems both possess vanishing infinite-wavelength local-volume-fraction fluctuations and quasi-long-range pair correlations scaling as r(-(d+1)) in d Euclidean dimensions. Our results suggest a strong generalization of a conjecture by Torquato and Stillinger {\{}[{\}}Phys. Rev. E 68, 041113 (2003)], namely, that all strictly jammed saturated packings of hard particles, including those with size and shape distributions, are hyperuniform with signature quasi-long-range correlations. We show that our arguments concerning the constrained distribution of the void space in MRJ packings directly extend to hard-ellipse and superdisk packings, thereby providing a direct structural explanation for the appearance of hyperuniformity and quasi-long-range correlations in these systems. Additionally, we examine general heterogeneous media with anisotropic inclusions and show unexpectedly that one can decorate a periodic point pattern to obtain a hard-particle system that is not hyperuniform with respect to local-volume-fraction fluctuations. This apparent discrepancy can also be rationalized by appealing to the irregular distribution of the void space arising from the anisotropic shapes of the particles. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that the MRJ states of hard particles share certain universal features independent of the local properties of the packings, including the packing fraction and average contact number per particle.},

apply to random packings of athermal particles. Although a jamming phase
diagram has recently been proposed for hard spheres with varying
friction, here we use a frictionless emulsion system in the presence of
depletion forces to sample the available phase space of packing
configurations. Using confocal microscopy, we access their packing
microstructure and test the theoretical assumptions. As a function of
attraction, our packing protocol under gravity leads to well-defined
jammed structures in which global density initially increases above
random close packing and subsequently decreases monotonically.
Microscopically, the fluctuations in parameters describing each
particle, such as the coordination number, number of neighbors, and
local packing fraction, are for all attractions in excellent agreement
with a local stochastic model, indicating that long-range correlations
are not important. Furthermore, the distributions of local cell volumes
can be collapsed onto a universal curve using the predicted k-gamma
distribution, in which the shape parameter k is fixed by the
polydispersity while the effect of attraction is captured by rescaling
the average cell volume. Within the Edwards statistical mechanics
framework, this result measures the decrease in compactivity with global
density, which represents a direct experimental test of a jamming phase

We find that as the number of facets of the particles increases, the translational order in the packings increases while the orientational order decreases. Moreover, we show that the MRJ packings are hyperuniform (i.e., their infinite-wavelength local-number-density fluctuations vanish) and possess quasi-long-range pair correlations that decay asymptotically with scaling r(-4). This provides further evidence that hyperuniform quasi-long-range correlations are a universal feature of MRJ packings of frictionless particles of general shape. However, unlike MRJ packings of ellipsoids, superballs, and superellipsoids, which are hypostatic, MRJ packings of the nontiling Platonic solids are isostatic. We provide a rationale for the organizing principle that the MRJ packing fractions for nonspherical particles with sufficiently small asphericities exceed the corresponding value for spheres (similar to 0.64).

abstract = {One well-known shortcoming of widely used biomolecular force fields is
the description of the directional dependence of hydrogen bonding (HB).
Here we aim to better understand the origin of this difficulty and thus
provide some guidance for further force field development. Our
theoretical approaches center on a novel density-based energy
decomposition analysis (DEDA) method (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 164112),
in which the frozen density energy is variationally determined through
constrained search. This unique and most significant feature of DEDA
enables us to find that the frozen density interaction term is the key
factor in determining the FIB orientation, while the sum of polarization
and charge-transfer components shows very little HB directional
dependence. This new insight suggests that the difficulty for current
nonpolarizable force fields to describe the HB directional dependence is
not due to the lack of explicit polarization or charge-transfer terms.
Using the DEDA results as reference, we further demonstrate that the
main failure coming from the atomic point charge model can be overcome
largely by introducing extra charge sites or higher order multipole
moments. Among all the electrostatic models explored, the smeared charge
distributed multipole model (up to quadrupole), which also takes account
of charge penetration effects, gives the best agreement with the
corresponding DEDA results. Meanwhile, our results indicate that the van
der Waals interaction term needs to be further improved to better model
directional HB.},

abstract = {It is well known that two regular tetrahedra can be combined with a
single regular octahedron to tile (complete fill) three-dimensional
Euclidean space R(3). This structure was called the ``octet truss{\{}''{\}} by
Buckminster Fuller. It was believed that such a tiling, which is the
Delaunay tessellation of the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, and its
closely related stacking variants, are the only tessellations of R(3)
that involve two different regular polyhedra. Here we identify and
analyze a unique family comprised of a noncountably infinite number of
periodic tilings of R(3) whose smallest repeat tiling unit consists of
one regular octahedron and six smaller regular tetrahedra. We first
derive an extreme member of this unique tiling family by showing that
the ``holes{\{}''{\}} in the optimal lattice packing of octahedra, obtained by
Minkowski over a century ago, are congruent tetrahedra. This tiling has
694 distinct concave (i.e., nonconvex) repeat units, 24 of which possess
central symmetry, and hence is distinctly different and combinatorically
richer than the fcc tetrahedra-octahedra tiling, which only has two
distinct tiling units. Then we construct a one-parameter family of
octahedron packings that continuously spans from the fcc to the optimal
lattice packing of octahedra. We show that the ``holes{\{}''{\}} in these
packings, except for the two extreme cases, are tetrahedra of two sizes,
leading to a family of periodic tilings with units composed four small
tetrahedra and two large tetrahedra that contact an octahedron. These
tilings generally possess 2,068 distinct concave tiling units, 62 of
which are centrally symmetric.},

X-ray diffraction reveals that nanocrystals of malonic acid (n = 3)
grown in 14, 30, and 40 nm diameter pores adopted two preferred mutually
perpendicular orientations simultaneously, each orientation coinciding
with the direction of hydrogen-bonded chains in the solid state.
Nanocrystals of glutaric acid (n = 5) embedded within 30 and 40 nm pores
adopted orientations with hydrogen-bonded chains coincident with the
pore direction, but the chains were perpendicular to the pore direction
in 14 nm pores. Pimelic acid (n = 7) nanocrystals were oriented with
their hydrogen-bonded chains parallel to the pore direction, but
nanocrystals of longer alkane dicarboxylic acids (n = 9, 11, or 13)
adopted orientations in which the their hydrogen-bonded chains
progressively tilted away from the pore direction as the alkane length
was increased. This behavior can be attributed to increasingly strong
dispersive interactions between the alkane chains, which alter the
ranking of the fast growing crystal directions. The appearance of
preferred orientations for embedded nanocrystals argues that critical
size effects and surface energy considerations favor precritical nuclei
that are oriented with their fast growth axis aligned with the pore
direction. This condition permits the nuclei to achieve critical size
more readily while minimizing the area of planes with high surface
energies, thereby providing a competitive advantage over other
orientations during nucleation. The observation in some cases of two
orientations simultaneously and size-dependent orientations reveals the
delicate balance of free energies among differently oriented nuclei.
Collectively, these observations demonstrate the utility of nanoscale
confinement for investigating the earliest stages of crystal growth.},

abstract = {The phase behaviors of crystalline solids embedded within nanoporous
matrices have been studied for decades. Classic nucleation theory
conjectures that phase stability is determined by the balance between an
unfavorable surface free energy and a stabilizing volume free energy.
The size constraint imposed by nanometer-scale pores during
crystallization results in large ratios of surface area to volume, which
are reflected in crystal properties. For example, melting points and
enthalpies of fusion of nanoscale crystals can differ drastically from
their bulk scale counterparts. Moreover, confinement within nanoscale
pores can dramatically influence crystallization pathways and crystal
polymorphism, particularly when the pore dimensions are comparable to
the critical size of; an emerging nucleus. At this tipping point, the
surface and volume free energies are in delicate balance and polymorph
stability rankings may differ from bulk. Recent investigations have
demonstrated that confined crystallization can be used to screen for and
control polymorphism. In the food, pharmaceutical, explosive, and dye
technological sectors, this understanding and control over polymorphism
is critical both for function and for regulatory compliance.
This Account reviews recent studies of the polymorphic and thermotropic
properties of crystalline materials embedded in the nanometer-scale
pores of porous glass powders and porous block-polymer-derived plastic
monoliths. The embedded nanocrystals exhibit an array of phase
behaviors, including the selective formation of metastable amorphous and
crystalline phases, thermodynamic stabilization of normally metastable
phases, size-dependent polymorphism, formation of new polymorphs, and
shifts of thermotropic relationships between polymorphs. Size
confinement also permits the measurement of thermotropic properties that
cannot be measured in bulk materials using conventional methods.
Well-aligned cylindrical pores of the polymer monoliths also allow
determination and manipulation of nanocrystal orientation. In these
systems, the constraints imposed by the pore walls result In a
competition between crystal nuclei that favors those with the fastest
growth direction aligned with the pore axis.
Collectively, the examples described in this Account provide substantial
insight into crystallization at a size scale that Is difficult to
realize by other means. Moreover, the behaviors resulting from
nanoscopic confinement are remarkably consistent for a wide range of
compounds, suggesting a reliable approach to studying the phase
behaviors of compounds at the nanoscale. Newly emerging classes of
porous materials promise expanded explorations of crystal growth under
confinement and new routes to controlling crystallization outcomes.},

oligomeric matrix protein (C) coiled-coil domain (His6-C) and two

explored. All proteins have an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6) that
interacts with divalent metal ions Zn(II) and Ni(II). Binding to Zn(II)
confers enhanced helical structure and stability, while Ni(II) promotes
aggregation. Surprisingly, His6-L44A undergoes a conformational switch

visibly cluster, forming large fiber mats in the case of His6-C and
His6-T40A or aggregated structures as observed for His6-L44A. Due to the
unique pentameric assembly of the proteins, recognition of a small
molecule within the pore is assessed using curcumin as the guest
molecule. In the presence of Zn(II), there is enhanced binding to

abstract = {While the rheology of non-Brownian suspensions in the dilute regime is
well understood, their behavior in the dense limit remains mystifying.
As the packing fraction of particles increases, particle motion becomes
more collective, leading to a growing length scale and scaling
properties in the rheology as the material approaches the jamming
transition. There is no accepted microscopic description of this
phenomenon. However, in recent years it has been understood that the
elasticity of simple amorphous solids is governed by a critical point,
the unjamming transition where the pressure vanishes, and where elastic
properties display scaling and a diverging length scale. The
correspondence between these two transitions is at present unclear. Here
we show that for a simple model of dense flow, which we argue captures
the essential physics near the jamming threshold, a formal analogy can
be made between the rheology of the flow and the elasticity of simple
networks. This analogy leads to a new conceptual framework to relate
microscopic structure to rheology. It enables us to define and compute
numerically normal modes and a density of states. We find striking
similarities between the density of states in flow, and that of
amorphous solids near unjamming: both display a plateau above some
frequency scale omega{\{}*{\}} similar to vertical bar z(c) - z vertical bar,
where z is the coordination of the network of particle in contact, z(c)
= 2D where D is the spatial dimension. However, a spectacular difference
appears: the density of states in flow displays a single mode at another
frequency scale omega(min) {\textless}{\textless} omega{\{}*{\}} governing the divergence of the

abstract = {The flow of viscoelastic fluids is an area in which analytical results are difficult to attain, yet can provide invaluable information. We develop a weak-coupling expansion that allows for semi-analytical computations of viscoelastic fluid flows coupled to immersed structures. In our method, a leading-order polymeric stress evolves according to a Newtonian velocity field, and this stress is used to correct the motion of bodies. We apply the method to the transient problem of a sphere settling through a viscoelastic fluid using the Oldroyd-B model, and recover previous results and observed behavior. The theory presented here is in contrast to the retarded-motion, or low-Weissenberg-number, expansions that have seen much application. One advantage of the weak-coupling method is that it offers information for Weissenberg numbers larger than one. The expansion's limit of validity is closely related to the diluteness criterion of a Boger fluid. We extend the classical settling problem to include an oscillatory body-force, and show how the introduction of a second time-scale modifies the body-dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the first paper of this series {\{}[{\}}S. Torquato, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 054106 (2012)], analytical results concerning the continuum percolation of overlapping hyperparticles in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d were obtained, including lower bounds on the percolation threshold. In the present investigation, we provide additional analytical results for certain cluster statistics, such as the concentration of k-mers and related quantities, and obtain an upper bound on the percolation threshold eta(c). We utilize the tightest lower bound obtained in the first paper to formulate an efficient simulation method, called the rescaled-particle algorithm, to estimate continuum percolation properties across many space dimensions with heretofore unattained accuracy. This simulation procedure is applied to compute the threshold eta(c) and associated mean number of overlaps per particle N-c for both overlapping hyperspheres and oriented hypercubes for 3 {\textless}= d {\textless}= 11. These simulations results are compared to corresponding upper and lower bounds on these percolation properties. We find that the bounds converge to one another as the space dimension in-creases, but the lower bound provides an excellent estimate of eta(c). and N-c, even for relatively low dimensions. We confirm a prediction of the first paper in this series that low-dimensional percolation properties encode high-dimensional information. We also show that the concentration of monomers; dominate over concentration values for higher order clusters (dimers, trimers, etc.) as the space dimension becomes large. Finally, we provide accurate analytical estimates of the pair connectedness; function and blocking function at their contact values for any d as a function of density.

abstract = {We present evidence that a rock sample found in the Koryak Mountains in
Russia and containing icosahedrite, an icosahedral quasicrystalline
phase with composition Al63Cu24Fe13, is part of a meteorite, likely
formed in the early solar system about 4.5 Gya. The quasicrystal grains
are intergrown with diopside, forsterite, stishovite, and additional
metallic phases {\{}[{\}}khatyrkite (CuAl2), cupalite (CuAl), and beta-phase
(AlCuFe)]. This assemblage, in turn, is enclosed in a white rind
consisting of diopside, hedenbergite, spinel (MgAl2O4), nepheline, and
forsterite. Particularly notable is a grain of stishovite (from the
interior), a tetragonal polymorph of silica that only occurs at
ultrahigh pressures ({\textgreater}= 10 Gpa), that contains an inclusion of
quasicrystal. An extraterrestrial origin is inferred from secondary ion
mass spectrometry O-18/O-16 and O-17/O-16 measurements of the pyroxene
and olivine intergrown with the metal that show them to have isotopic
compositions unlike any terrestrial minerals and instead overlap those
of anhydrous phases in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The spinel
from the white rind has an isotopic composition suggesting that it was
part of a calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion similar to those found in CV3
chondrites. The mechanism that produced this exotic assemblage is not
yet understood. The assemblage (metallic copper-aluminum alloy) is
extremely reduced, and the close association of aluminum (high
temperature refractory lithophile) with copper (low temperature
chalcophile) is unexpected. Nevertheless, our evidence indicates that
quasicrystals can form naturally under astrophysical conditions and
remain stable over cosmic timescales, giving unique insights on their
existence in nature and stability.},

These results lead to lower bounds on the percolation threshold density eta(c), which become progressively tighter as d increases and exact asymptotically as d -{\textgreater} infinity, i.e., eta(c) -{\textgreater} 2(-d). Our analysis is aided by a certain remarkable duality between the equilibrium hard-hypersphere (hypercube) fluid system and the continuum percolation model of overlapping hyperspheres (hypercubes). Analogies between these two seemingly different problems are described. We also obtain Percus-Yevick-like approximations for the mean cluster number S in any dimension d that also become asymptotically exact as d -{\textgreater} infinity. We infer that as the space dimension increases, finite-sized clusters become more ramified or ``branch-like.{\{}''{\}} These analytical estimates are used to assess simulation results for eta(c) up to 20 dimensions in the case of hyperspheres and up to 15 dimensions in the case of hypercubes. Our analysis sheds light on the radius of convergence of the density expansion for S and naturally leads to an analytical approximation for eta(c) that applies across all dimensions for both hyperspheres and oriented hypercubes. Finally, we describe the extension of our results to the case of overlapping particles of general anisotropic shape in d dimensions with a specified orientational probability distribution.

abstract = {Understanding the effect of curvature and topological frustration in
crystals yields insights into the fragility of the ordered state. For
instance, a one-dimensional crystal of identical charged particles can
accommodate an extra particle (interstitial) if all the particle
positions are readjusted, yet in a planar hexagonal crystal
interstitials remain trapped between lattice sites and diffuse by
hopping(1-3). Using optical tweezers operated independently of
three-dimensional imaging, we inserted interstitials in a lattice of
similar colloidal particles sitting on flat or curved oil/glycerol
interfaces, and imaged the ensuing dynamics. We find that, unlike in
flat space, the curved crystals self-heal through a collective particle
rearrangement that redistributes the increased density associated with
the interstitial. This process can be interpreted in terms of the
out-of-equilibrium interaction of topological defects with each other
and with the underlying curvature. Our observations suggest the
existence of particle fractionalization on curved surface crystals.},

abstract = {Lateral lipid phase separation of titratable PS or PA lipids and their
assembly in domains induced by changes in pH are significant in
liposome-based drug delivery: environmentally responsive lipid
heterogeneities can be tuned to alter collective membrane properties
such as permeability (altering drug release) and surface topography
(altering drug carrier reactivity) impacting, therefore, the therapeutic
outcomes. At the micrometer scale fluorescence microscopy on giant
unilamellar fluid vesicles (GUVs) shows that lowering pH (from 7.0 to
5.0) promotes condensation of titratable PS or PA lipids into beautiful
floret-shaped domains in which lipids are tightly packed via
hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions. The order of lipid
packing within domains increases radially toward the domain center.
Lowering pH enhances the lipid packing order, and at pH 5.0 domains
appear to be entirely in the solid (gel) phase. Domains
phenomenologically comprise a circular ``core{\{}''{\}} cap beyond which
interfacial instabilities emerge resembling leaf-like stripes. At pH 5.0
stripes are of almost vanishing Gaussian curvature independent of GUVs'
preparation path and in agreement with a general condensation mechanism.
Increasing incompressibility of domains is strongly correlated with a
larger number of thinner stripes per domain and increasing relative
rigidity of domains with smaller core cap areas. Line tension drives
domain ripening; however, the final domain shape is a result of enhanced
incompressibility and rigidity maximized by domain coupling across the
bilayer. Introduction of a transmembrane osmotic gradient (hyperosmotic
on the outer lipid leaflet) allows the domain condensation process to
reach its maximum extent which, however, is limited by the minimal
expansivity of the continuous fluid membrane.},

abstract = {DNA is increasingly used as an important tool in programming the
self-assembly of micrometer-and nanometer-scale particles. This is
largely due to the highly specific thermoreversible interaction of cDNA
strands, which, when placed on different particles, have been used to
bind precise pairs in aggregates and crystals. However, DNA
functionalized particles will only reach their true potential for
particle assembly when each particle can address and bind to many
different kinds of particles. Indeed, specifying all bonds can force a
particular designed structure. In this paper, we present the design
rules for multiflavored particles and show that a single particle, DNA
functionalized with many different ``flavors,{\{}''{\}} can recognize and bind
specifically to many different partners. We investigate the cost of
increasing the number of flavors in terms of the reduction in binding
energy and melting temperature. We find that a single 2-mu m colloidal
particle can bind to 40 different types of particles in an easily
accessible time and temperature regime. The practical limit of similar
to 100 is set by entropic costs for particles to align complementary
pairs and, surprisingly, by the limited number of distinct ``useful{\{}''{\}}
DNA sequences that prohibit subunits with nonspecific binding. For our
11 base ``sticky ends,{\{}''{\}} the limit is 73 distinct sequences with no
unwanted overlaps of 5 bp or more. As an example of phenomena enabled by
polygamous particles, we demonstrate a three-particle system that forms

In a recent work {\{}[{\}}Hopkins et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 125501 (2011)], we summarized these findings.

statistics of these times reveal whether the protein domains are
independent of one another, the mechanical hierarchy in the polyprotein

which they originate. It is therefore important to use robust
statistical tests to decipher the correct theoretical model underlying
the process. Here, we develop multiple techniques to compare the
well-established experimental data set on ubiquitin with existing
theoretical models as a case study. We show that robustness against
filtering, agreement with a maximum likelihood function that takes into
account experimental artifacts, the Kuiper statistic test, and alignment
with synthetic data all identify the Weibull or stretched exponential
distribution as the best fitting model. Our results are inconsistent
with recently proposed models of Gaussian disorder in the energy
landscape or noise in the applied force as explanations for the observed

abstract = {Dense packings of hard particles have important applications in many fields, including condensed matter physics, discrete geometry, and cell biology. In this paper, we employ a stochastic search implementation of the Torquato-Jiao adaptive-shrinking-cell (ASC) optimization scheme {\{}[{\}}Nature (London) 460, 876 (2009)] to find maximally dense particle packings in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d. While the original implementation was designed to study spheres and convex polyhedra in d {\textgreater}= 3, our implementation focuses on d = 2 and extends the algorithm to include both concave polygons and certain complex convex or concave nonpolygonal particle shapes. We verify the robustness of this packing protocol by successfully reproducing the known putative optimal packings of congruent copies of regular pentagons and octagons, then employ it to suggest dense packing arrangements of congruent copies of certain families of concave crosses, convex and concave curved triangles (incorporating shapes resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo), and ``moonlike{\{}''{\}} shapes. Analytical constructions are determined subsequently to obtain the densest known packings of these particle shapes. For the examples considered, we find that the densest packings of both convex and concave particles with central symmetry are achieved by their corresponding optimal Bravais lattice packings; for particles lacking central symmetry, the densest packings obtained are nonlattice periodic packings, which are consistent with recently-proposed general organizing principles for hard particles. Moreover, we find that the densest known packings of certain curved triangles are periodic with a four-particle basis, and we find that the densest known periodic packings of certain moonlike shapes possess no inherent symmetries. Our work adds to the growing evidence that particle shape can be used as a tuning parameter to achieve a diversity of packing structures.},

We find that the dependence of the neighbor number on cell size is quasilinear in the monodisperse case and becomes nonlinear above a threshold polydispersity, independent of the method of creation of the tiling. These size-topology relations can be described by a simple analytical theory, which quantifies the effects of positional disorder in the monodisperse case and those of size disorder in the polydisperse case and is applicable in two and three dimensions. The theory thus gives a unifying framework for a wide range of amorphous systems, ranging from biological tissues, foams, and bidisperse disks to compressed emulsions and granular matter.},

All of our organizing principles are applied to and tested against the most comprehensive set of both convex and concave particle shapes examined to date, including Catalan solids, prisms, antiprisms, cylinders, dimers of spheres, and various concave polyhedra. We demonstrate that all of the densest known packings associated with this wide spectrum of nonspherical particles are consistent with our propositions. Among other applications, our general organizing principles enable us to construct analytically the densest known packings of certain convex nonspherical particles, including spherocylinders, ``lens-shaped{\{}''{\}} particles, square pyramids, and rhombic pyramids. Moreover, we show how to apply these principles to infer the high-density equilibrium crystalline phases of hard convex and concave particles. We also discuss the unique packing attributes of maximally random jammed packings of nonspherical particles.},

coupling across various positions within one turn of DNA. Four
2'-modified nucleotides were synthesized as protected phosphoramidites
and incorporated into DNA oligonucleotides. The modified nucleotides
contain either 5-atom or 16-atom linker components, with either amine or
carboxylic acid functional groups at their termini, forming 10 or 32
atom (11 or 33 bond) linkages. Chemical coupling of the amine and
carboxylate groups in designed strands resulted in the formation of an
amide bond. Coupling efficiency as a function of trajectory distance
between the individual linker components was examined. For those
nucleotides capable of forming inter-strand cross-links (ICLs), coupling
yields were found to depend on temperature, distance, and linker length,
enabling several approaches that can control regioselective linkage. In
the most favorable cases, the coupling yields are quantitative.
Spectroscopic measurements of strands that were chemically cross-linked
indicate that the global structure of the DNA duplex does not appear to
be distorted from the B form after coupling. Thermal denaturing profiles
of those strands were shifted to somewhat higher temperatures than those
of their respective control duplexes. Thus, the robust amide ICLs formed
by this approach are site-specific, do not destabilize the rest of the
duplex, and only minimally perturb the secondary structure.},

abstract = {We generate jammed disordered packings of 100 {\textless}= N {\textless}= 2000 monodisperse hard spheres in three dimensions whose strictly jammed backbones are demonstrated to be exactly isostatic with unprecedented numerical accuracy. This is accomplished by using the Torquato-Jiao (TJ) packing algorithm as a means of studying the maximally random jammed (MRJ) state. The rattler fraction of these packings converges towards 0.015 in the infinite-system limit, which is markedly lower than previous estimates for the MRJ state using the Lubachevsky-Stillinger protocol. This is because the packings that the TJ algorithm creates are closer to the true MRJ state, as shown using bond-orientational and translational order metrics. The rattler pair correlation statistics exhibit strongly correlated behavior contrary to the conventional understanding that they be randomly (Poisson) distributed. Dynamically interacting ``polyrattlers{\{}''{\}} may be found imprisoned in shared cages as well as interacting through ``bottlenecks{\{}''{\}} in the backbone and these clusters are mainly responsible for the sharp increase in the rattler pair correlation function near contact. We discover the surprising existence of polyrattlers with cluster sizes of up to five rattlers (which is expected to increase with system size) and present a distribution of polyrattler occurrence as a function of cluster size and system size. We also enumerate all of the rattler interaction topologies we observe and present images of several examples, showing that MRJ packings of monodisperse spheres can contain large rattler cages while still obeying the strict jamming criterion. The backbone spheres that encage the rattlers are significantly hypostatic, implying that correspondingly hyperstatic regions must exist elsewhere in these isostatic packings. We also observe that rattlers in hard-sphere packings share an apparent connection with the low-temperature two-level system anomalies that appear in real amorphous insulators and semiconductors.},

those of tetrabenzoheptacene (TBH) and 1,2:5,6-dibenzanthracene (DBT),
both flat polyacenes, in an electric field results in the formation of
ordered 2D packings that mimic the plane group symmetries in their
respective molecular crystal equivalents. Whereas the particles packed
in low-density disordered arrangements under a gravitational gradient,
dielectrophoresis (under an ac electric field) produced ordered
high-density packings with readily identifiable plane group symmetry.
The ordered colloidal assemblies were stable for hours, with the packing
density decreasing slowly but with recognizable symmetry for up to 12 h
for the TBH-shaped particles and up to 4 h for the DBT-shaped particles.
This unexpected stability is attributed to jamming behavior associated
with interlocking of the dogbone-shaped (TBH) and Z-block (DBT)
particles, contrasting with the more rapid reduction of packing density
and loss of hexagonal symmetry for disk-shaped particles upon removal of
the electric field. The TBH-shaped and DBT-shaped particles assemble
into the p2 plane group, which corresponds to the densest particle
packing among the possible close-packed plane groups for these particle
symmetries. The p2 symmetry observed for the TBH-shaped and DBT-shaped
colloid crystal emulates the p2 symmetry of the (010) layers in their
respective molecular crystals, which crystallize in monoclinic lattices.
Notably, DBT-shaped particles also form ordered domains with pgg
symmetry, replicating the plane group symmetry of the (100) layer in the
orthorhombic polymorph of DBT. These observations illustrate that the 2D
ordering of colloid particles can mimic the packing of molecules with
similar shapes, demonstrating that packing can transcend length scales
from the molecular to the colloidal.},

abstract = {Finding the densest sphere packing in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d is an outstanding fundamental problem with relevance in many fields, including the ground states of molecular systems, colloidal crystal structures, coding theory, discrete geometry, number theory, and biological systems. Numerically generating the densest sphere packings becomes very challenging in high dimensions due to an exponentially increasing number of possible sphere contacts and sphere configurations, even for the restricted problem of finding the densest lattice sphere packings. In this paper we apply the Torquato-Jiao packing algorithm, which is a method based on solving a sequence of linear programs, to robustly reproduce the densest known lattice sphere packings for dimensions 2 through 19. We show that the TJ algorithm is appreciably more efficient at solving these problems than previously published methods. Indeed, in some dimensions, the former procedure can be as much as three orders of magnitude faster at finding the optimal solutions than earlier ones. We also study the suboptimal local density-maxima solutions (inherent structures or ``extreme{\{}''{\}} lattices) to gain insight about the nature of the topography of the ``density{\{}''{\}} landscape.},

the coiled-coil region of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (C). The
resulting aqueous mixtures reveal improved mechanical integrity for the

contrast to EC+t-CNC, which does not form a gel, indicating that block
orientation influences the ability to interact with t-CNCs. Surface

mechanical properties of the two samples are due to the prevalent
display of the E domain by CE, which interacts more with t-CNCs leading
to a stronger network with t-CNCs. On the other hand, EC, which is
predominantly C-rich on its surface, does not interact as much with
t-CNCs. This suggests that the surface characteristics of the protein
polymers, due to folding and self-assembly, are important factors for
the interactions with t-CNCs, and a significant influence on the overall

These results lead to certain lower bounds on the percolation threshold p(c) that become progressively tighter as d increases and asymptotically exact as d becomes large. These lower-bound estimates depend on the structure of the d-dimensional lattice and whether site or bond percolation is being considered. We obtain explicit bounds on p(c) for both site and bond percolation on five different lattices: d-dimensional generalizations of the simple-cubic, body-centered-cubic, and face-centered-cubic Bravais lattices as well as the d-dimensional generalizations of the diamond and kagome (or pyrochlore) non-Bravais lattices. These analytical estimates are used to assess available simulation results across dimensions (up through d = 13 in some cases). It is noteworthy that the tightest lower bound provides reasonable estimates of p(c) in relatively low dimensions and becomes increasingly accurate as d grows. We also derive high-dimensional asymptotic expansions for p(c) for the 10 percolation problems and compare them to the Bethe-lattice approximation. Finally, we remark on the radius of convergence of the series expansion of S in powers of p as the dimension grows. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.032149},

abstract = {Previous attempts to simulate disordered binary sphere packings have been limited in producing mechanically stable, isostatic packings across a broad spectrum of packing fractions. Here we report that disordered strictly jammed binary packings (packings that remain mechanically stable under general shear deformations and compressions) can be produced with an anomalously large range of average packing fractions 0.634 {\textless}= phi {\textless}= 0.829 for small to large sphere radius ratios alpha restricted to alpha {\textgreater}= 0.100. Surprisingly, this range of average packing fractions is obtained for packings containing a subset of spheres (called the backbone) that are exactly strictly jammed, exactly isostatic, and also generated from random initial conditions. Additionally, the average packing fractions of these packings at certain a and small sphere relative number concentrations x approach those of the corresponding densest known ordered packings. These findings suggest for entropic reasons that these high-density disordered packings should be good glass formers and that they may be easy to prepare experimentally. We also identify an unusual feature of the packing fraction of jammed backbones (packings with rattlers excluded). The backbone packing fraction is about 0.624 over the majority of the alpha-x plane, even when large numbers of small spheres are present in the backbone. Over the (relatively small) area of the alpha-x plane where the backbone is not roughly constant, we find that backbone packing fractions range from about 0.606 to 0.829, with the volume of rattler spheres comprising between 1.6{\%} and 26.9{\%} of total sphere volume. To generate isostatic strictly jammed packings, we use an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao sequential linear programming algorithm {\{}[{\}}Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302 (2010)], which is an efficient producer of inherent structures (mechanically stable configurations at the local maxima in the density landscape). The identification and explicit construction of binary packings with such high packing fractions could have important practical implications for granular composites where density is critical both to material properties and fabrication cost, including for solid propellants, concrete, and ceramics. The densities and structures of jammed binary packings at various alpha and x are also relevant to the formation of a glass phase in multicomponent metallic systems.},

abstract = {We study the effect of dimensionality on the percolation threshold eta(c) of identical overlapping nonspherical convex hyperparticles in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d. This is done by formulating a scaling relation for eta(c) that is based on a rigorous lower bound {\{}[{\}}Torquato, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 054106 (2012)] and a conjecture that hyperspheres provide the highest threshold, for any d, among all convex hyperparticle shapes (that are not a trivial affine transformation of a hypersphere). This scaling relation also exploits the recently discovered principle that low-dimensional continuum percolation behavior encodes high-dimensional information. We derive an explicit formula for the exclusion volume v(ex) of a hyperparticle of arbitrary shape in terms of its d-dimensional volume v, surface area s, and radius of mean curvature (R) over bar (or, equivalently, mean width). These basic geometrical properties are computed for a wide variety of nonspherical hyperparticle shapes with random orientations across all dimensions, including, among other shapes, various polygons for d = 2, Platonic solids, spherocylinders, parallepipeds, and zero-volume plates for d = 3 and their appropriate generalizations for d {\textgreater}= 4. Using this information, we compute the lower bound and scaling relation for eta(c) for this comprehensive set of continuum percolation models across dimensions. We demonstrate that the scaling relation provides accurate upper-bound estimates of the threshold eta(c) across dimensions and becomes increasingly accurate as the space dimension increases.

microdiffraction indicated that the {\{}[{\}}010] axis of the embedded
beta-glycine nanocrystals coincided with the pore direction, identical
to behavior observed previously in the cylindrical nanopores of polymer
monoliths. Whereas the beta-glycine nanocrystals were stable
indefinitely in ambient air and persisted upon heating, they transformed
to the alpha polymorph upon standing at room temperature and 90{\%}
relative humidity (RH). The alpha-glycine nanocrystals were oriented
with the {\{}[{\}}010] axis nearly perpendicular to the pore direction,
reflecting a nearly 90 degrees rotation of the glycine molecules during
the transition. When the beta-glycine nanocrystals were formed in the
AAO cylinders in the presence of small amounts of racemic hydrophobic
amino acid auxiliaries, which are known to bind selectively to the (010)
and (0 (1) over bar0) faces on the fast-growing end of beta-glycine
enantiomorphs, the beta -{\textgreater} alpha phase transition at 90{\%} RH was
suppressed. In contrast, beta-glycine nanocrystals grown in the presence
of an enantiopure amino acid auxiliary, which binds to the fast-growing
end of only one of the enantiomorphs, thus suppressing its formation and
leaving the other enantiomorph unperturbed, transformed into the alpha
polymorph under the same conditions. This observation confirms that
binding of an amino acid to the {\{}010{\}} faces is stereoselective and
that access of water to these faces is essential for the transition to

abstract = {The study of the packing of hard hyperspheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d has been a topic of great interest in statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory. While the densest known packings are ordered in sufficiently low dimensions, it has been suggested that in sufficiently large dimensions, the densest packings might be disordered. The random sequential addition (RSA) time-dependent packing process, in which congruent hard hyperspheres are randomly and sequentially placed into a system without interparticle overlap, is a useful packing model to study disorder in high dimensions. Of particular interest is the infinite-time saturation limit in which the available space for another sphere tends to zero. However, the associated saturation density has been determined in all previous investigations by extrapolating the density results for nearly saturated configurations to the saturation limit, which necessarily introduces numerical uncertainties. We have refined an algorithm devised by us {\{}[{\}}S. Torquato, O. U. Uche, and F. H. Stillinger, Phys. Rev. E 74, 061308 (2006)] to generate RSA packings of identical hyperspheres. The improved algorithm produce such packings that are guaranteed to contain no available space in a large simulation box using finite computational time with heretofore unattained precision and across the widest range of dimensions (2 {\textless}= d {\textless}= 8). We have also calculated the packing and covering densities, pair correlation function g(2)(r), and structure factor S(k) of the saturated RSA configurations. As the space dimension increases, we find that pair correlations markedly diminish, consistent with a recently proposed ``decorrelation{\{}''{\}} principle, and the degree of ``hyperuniformity{\{}''{\}} (suppression of infinite-wavelength density fluctuations) increases. We have also calculated the void exclusion probability in order to compute the so-called quantizer error of the RSA packings, which is related to the second moment of inertia of the average Voronoi cell. Our algorithm is easily generalizable to generate saturated RSA packings of nonspherical particles.},

The compact structure of FLNa 16-23 leads to a broad distribution of

multiple unraveling timescales in the force-clamp mode. Moreover, a
subset of force-extension trajectories reveals a mechanical hierarchy in

liberates the unfolding of individual domains at low forces (similar to
100 pN). This mechanism may also explain the order-of-magnitude
difference in the rates of the biexponential fits to the distribution of
unfolding dwell times under force-clamp. Overall, FLNa 16-23 under a
force of 100 pN is more compliant than the linear FLNa 1-8. Because a

abstract = {We study theoretically and numerically how hard frictionless particles

distinct unstable non-linear modes of rearrangement, both associated
with the opening and the closing of contacts. The first mode, whose
density is characterized by some exponent theta', corresponds to motions
of particles extending throughout the entire system. The second mode,
whose density is characterized by an exponent theta not equal theta',
corresponds to the local buckling of a few particles. Extended modes are
shown to yield at a much higher rate than local modes when a stress is
applied. We show that the distribution of contact forces follows P(f)
similar to f(min(theta',theta)), and that imposing the restriction that
the packing cannot be densified further leads to the bounds gamma {\textgreater}= 1/2

abstract = {Gels of semi-flexible polymers, network glasses made of low valence
elements, softly compressed ellipsoid particles and dense suspensions
under flow are examples of floppy materials. These systems present
collective motions with almost no restoring force. To study
theoretically and numerically the frequency-dependence of the response
of these materials and the length scales that characterize their
elasticity, we use a model of isotropic floppy elastic networks. We show
that such networks present a phonon gap for frequencies smaller than a
frequency omega{\{}*{\}} governed by coordination, and that the elastic
response is characterized, and in some cases localized, on a length
scale l(c) similar to 1/root omega{\{}*{\}} that diverges as the phonon gap
vanishes (with a logarithmic correction in the two dimensional case).
l(c) also characterizes velocity correlations under shear, whereas
another length scale l{\{}*{\}} similar to 1/omega{\{}*{\}} controls the effect of
pinning boundaries on elasticity. We discuss the implications of our
findings for suspension flows, and the correspondence between floppy
materials and amorphous solids near unjamming, where l(c) and l{\{}*{\}} have
also been identified but where their roles are not fully understood.},

explode, and re-form elsewhere. The dynamic assembly results from a
competition between self-propulsion of particles and an attractive
interaction induced respectively by osmotic and phoretic effects and
activated by light. We measured a transition from normal to giant-number
fluctuations. Our experiments are quantitatively described by simple
numerical simulations. We show that the existence of the living crystals

In this study, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the aggregation times of micron-scale particles as a function of DNA coverage and salt concentration. Our 2-mu m colloids accommodate up to 70 000 DNA strands. For full coverage and high salt concentration, the aggregation time is 5 min while for 0.1 coverage and low salt it is 4 days. A simple model using reaction-limited kinetics and experimental oligomer hybridization rates describes the data well. A controlling factor is the Coulomb barrier at the nanometer scale retarding DNA hybridization. Our model allows easy measurements of microscopic hybridization rates from macroscopic aggregation and enables the design of complex self-assembly schemes with controlled kinetics.},

steps: nucleation, crystal growth, crystal aggregation, and crystal

``imposters{\{}''{\}} at L-cystine crystal surfaces has been suggested as a
plausible route for the suppression of stones, understanding the factors
that govern crystal-crystal aggregation and adhesion of crystals to
epithelial cells also is essential for devising strategies to mitigate
L-cystine stone formation. Chemical force microscopy performed with
atomic force microscope tips decorated with functional groups commonly
found in urinary constituents that likely mediate aggregation and
attachment (e.g., COOH, NH2, SH, CH3, OH) revealed signatures that
reflect differences in the chemical affinity of these groups for the

L-cystine single crystals and the {\{}110{\}} faces of the non-native
tetragonal form. These signatures can be explained by the different
chemical compositions of the crystal faces, and they reveal a remarkable
binding specificity of the thiol group for the sulfur-rich {\{}100{\}} and
{\{}110{\}} faces of the hexagonal and tetragonal forms, respectively.
Collectively, these observations suggest that alterations of the crystal

doxorubicin and are labeled with an anti-HER2 peptide. In vitro,
anti-HER2 pH tunable vesicles release doxorubicin in a pH dependent

abstract = {Numerous recent investigations have been devoted to the determination of the equilibrium phase behavior and packing characteristics of hard nonspherical particles, including ellipsoids, superballs, and polyhedra, to name but just a few shapes. Systems of hard nonspherical particles exhibit a variety of stable phases with different degrees of translational and orientational order, including isotropic liquid, solid crystal, rotator and a variety of liquid crystal phases. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo implementation of the adaptive-shrinking-cell (ASC) numerical scheme and free-energy calculations to ascertain with high precision the equilibrium phase behavior of systems of congruent Archimedean truncated tetrahedra over the entire range of possible densities up to the maximal nearly space-filling density. In particular, we find that the system undergoes two first-order phase transitions as the density increases: first a liquid-solid transition and then a solid-solid transition. The isotropic liquid phase coexists with the Conway-Torquato (CT) crystal phase at intermediate densities, verifying the result of a previous qualitative study [ J. Chem. Phys. 2011 , 135 , 151101 ]. The freezing- and melting-point packing fractions for this transition are respectively ϕF = 0.496 ± 0.006 and ϕM = 0.591 ± 0.005. At higher densities, we find that the CT phase undergoes another first-order phase transition to one associated with the densest-known crystal, with coexistence densities in the range ϕ ∈ [0.780 ± 0.002, 0.802 ± 0.003]. We find no evidence for stable rotator (or plastic) or nematic phases. We also generate the maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of truncated tetrahedra, which may be regarded to be the glassy end state of a rapid compression of the liquid. Specifically, we systematically study the structural characteristics of the MRJ packings, including the centroidal pair correlation function, structure factor and orientational pair correlation function. We find that such MRJ packings are hyperuniform with an average packing fraction of 0.770, which is considerably larger than the corresponding value for identical spheres (≈ 0.64). We conclude with some simple observations concerning what types of phase transitions might be expected in general hard-particle systems based on the particle shape and which would be good glass formers.},

abstract = {Light-activated self-propelled colloids are synthesized and their active motion is studied using optical microscopy. We propose a versatile route using different photoactive materials, and demonstrate a multiwavelength activation and propulsion. Thanks to the photoelectrochemical properties of two semiconductor materials (alpha-Fe2O3 and TiO2), a light with an energy higher than the bandgap triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and produces a chemical cloud around the particle. It induces a phoretic attraction with neighbouring colloids as well as an osmotic self-propulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form colloidal cargos as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated component is embedded into a dielectric sphere. The particles are self-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations, and exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient surface density, the particles spontaneously form `living crystals' which are mobile, break apart and reform. Steering the particle with an external magnetic field, we show that the formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on of the particles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle of organization for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of particles self-propelled by different wavelength demonstrate a good understanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system and points to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled particles.},

Chromonic mesogens, small molecules that stack to form lyotropic liquid crystals, prompt structural questions that have yet to be answered; a full understanding of structure should inform colligative properties. Herein, the single crystal structure of a guanidinium salt of the sunset yellow dianion, a known chromonic mesogen, is reported. The compound crystallizes as a dihydrate, tetrahydrofuran solvate in the orthorhombic space group Pnna, with a = 6.8426(5) angstrom, b = 20.048(1) angstrom, c = 21.466(2) angstrom. The sunset yellow molecules, point group approximately C-s, are disordered about a crystallographic diad axis. The structure is informative because pairwise interactions in the disordered crystal structure show a remarkable correspondence with the stereochemistry of sunset yellow molecules in solution and in the liquid crystal phase. The solution structure is here simulated by the combination of molecular dynamics, metadynamics, and quantum chemical computations. The comparable disorder in the fluid and solid states suggests the possibility that stacked aggregates adhere to growing crystals intact. Computations were used to evaluate proposals that stacking faults and branching points lower the X-ray correlation lengths while preserving extended structures. Evidence is found for stacking faults but not branches. The solution stereochemistry and stereodynamics has implications for the geometry of long rods, for which understanding is a prerequisite for reckoning properties of vexing chromonic mesophases.},

This is done by applying the recently established ``hidden scale invariance{\{}''{\}} of simple liquids to the glass phase. The resulting scaling of flow-event properties reveals quasiuniversality, i.e., that the probability distributions of energy drops, stress drops, and strain intervals in properly reduced units are virtually independent of the microscopic pair potentials.},

abstract = {In granulation, a dense colloidal suspension is converted into pasty
lumps by application of flow. Often, such lumps are bistable: each can
exist either as a fluid droplet (with a shiny surface) or as a jammed
granule, whose rough surface creates a bulk stress via capillary action.
Such bistability can be explained if the bulk steady-state flow curve is
sufficiently nonmonotonic that, above some threshold of stress, flow
ceases entirely. This is a stronger condition than the one required to
see discontinuous shear thickening, but closely related to it. For
instance, inertia can play a role in shear thickening, but not in static
bistability. Suitable flow curves were previously found in a
phenomenological model of the colloidal glass transition, in which
Brownian motion is arrested at high stresses. However, granulation often
involves particles too large for Brownian motion to be significant, so
that another nonmonotonicity mechanism is needed. A very recent theory,
in which the proportion of frictional rather than lubricated contacts
increases with stress, provides just such a mechanism, and we use it
here to give a simple explanation of granular bistability in
non-Brownian suspensions, which requires knowledge only of the
steady-state flow curve. However, jamming is in general a
history-dependent phenomenon which allows bistability to arise under
broader conditions than those just described, possibly including systems
that do not shear-thicken at all. In this paper, we focus on
explanations of granular bistability based on steady-state
shear-thickening, but also discuss alternative explanations based on
flow history effects.},

abstract = {We report experiments studying the dynamics of dense non-Brownian fiber suspensions subjected to periodic oscillatory shear. We find that periodic shear initially causes fibers to collide and to undergo irreversible diffusion. As time progresses, the fibers tend to orient in the vorticity direction while the number of collisions decreases. Ultimately, the system goes to one of two steady states: an absorbing steady state, where collisions cease and the fibers undergo reversible trajectories; an active state, where fibers continue to collide causing them to diffuse and undergo irreversible trajectories. Collisions between fibers can be characterized by an effective volume fraction $\Phi$ with a critical volume fraction $\Phi$c that separates absorbing from active (diffusing) steady states. The effective volume fraction $\Phi$ depends on the mean fiber orientation and thus decreases in time as fibers progressively orient under periodic shear. In the limit that the temporal evolution of $\Phi$ is slow compared to the activity relaxation time $\tau$, all the data for all strain amplitudes and all concentrations can be scaled onto a single master curve with a functional dependence well-described by te(-tR), where tR is the rescaled time. As $\Phi$ → $\Phi$c, $\tau$ diverges. Therefore, for experiments in which $\Phi$(t) starts above $\Phi$c but goes to a steady state below $\Phi$c, departures from scaling are observed for $\Phi$ very near $\Phi$c. The critical exponents are measured to be $\beta$ = 0.84 ± 0.04 and $\nu$ = 1.1 ± 0.1, which is consistent with the Manna universality class for directed percolation.},

force spectroscopy to quantify the intra- and intermolecular forces

imaging, and the known chemical composition of marine gels allows us to
identify the microscopic origins of distinct mechanical responses. At
the single-fibril level, we uncover force-extension curves that resemble
those of individual polysaccharide fibrils. They exhibit entropic
elasticity followed by extensions associated with chair-to-boat
transitions specific to the type of polysaccharide at high forces.
Surprisingly, a low degree of cross-linking leads to sawtooth patterns
that we attribute to the unraveling of polysaccharide entanglements. At
a high degree of cross-linking, we observe force plateaus that arise
from unzipping, as well as unwinding, of helical bundles. Finally, the
complex 3D network structure gives rise to force staircases of
increasing height that correspond to the hierarchical peeling of fibrils
away from the junction zones. In addition, we show that these diverse
mechanical responses also arise in reconstituted polysaccharide gels,
which highlights their dominant role in the mechanical architecture of

properties: As the jamming threshold is approached, the viscosity

correlations. To unravel the microscopic mechanism governing dissipation

analogy between suspension flows and the rigidity transition occurring
when floppy networks are pulled, a transition believed to be associated
with the stress stiffening of certain gels. After deriving the critical
properties near the rigidity transition, we show numerically that
suspension flows lie close to it. We find that this proximity causes a
decoupling between viscosity and the correlation length of velocities
xi, which scales as the length l(c) characterizing the response to a
local perturbation, previously predicted to follow lc similar to 1/root

abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Owing to the mastery exhibited by Nature in integrating both
covalent and noncovalent interactions in a highly efficient manner, the
quest to construct polymeric systems that rival not only the precision
and fidelity but also the structure of natural systems has remained a
daunting challenge. Supramolecular chemists have long endeavored to
control the interplay between covalent and noncovalent bond formation,
so as to examine and fully comprehend how function is predicated on
self-assembly. The ability to reliably control polymer self-assembly is
essential to generate ``smart{\{}''{\}} materials and has the potential to
tailor polymer properties (i.e., viscosity, electronic properties)
through fine-tuning the noncovalent interactions that comprise the
polymer architecture. In this context, supramolecular polymers have a
distinct advantage over fully covalent systems in that they are
dynamically modular, since noncovalent recognition motifs can be
engineered to either impart a desired functionality within the overall
architecture or provide a designed bias for the self-assembly process.
In this Account, we describe engineering principles being developed and
pursued by our group that exploit the orthogonal nature of noncovalent
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and
Coulombic interactions, to direct the self-assembly of functionalized
macromolecules, resulting in the formation of supramolecular polymers.
To begin, we describe our efforts to fabricate a modular
poly(norbornene)-based scaffold via ring-opening metathesis
polymerization (ROMP), wherein pendant molecular recognition elements
based upon nudeobase-mimicking elements (e.g., thymine, diaminotriazine)
or SCS-Pd-II pincer were integrated within covalent monofunctional or
symmetrically functionalized polymers. The simple polymer backbones
exhibited reliable self-assembly with complementary polymers or small
molecules. Within these systems, we applied successful protecting group
strategies and template polymerizations to enhance the control afforded
by ROMP. Main-chain-functionalized alternating block polymers based upon
SCS-Pd-II pincer-pyridine motifs were achieved through the combined
exploitation of bimetallic initiators and supramolecularly
functionalized terminators. Our initial design principles led to the
successful fabrication of both main-chain- and side-chain-functionalized
poly(norbornenes) via ROMP.
Utilizing all of these techniques in concert led to engineering
orthogonality while achieving complexity through the installation of
multiple supramolecular motifs within the side chain, main chain, or
both in our polymer systems. The exploitation and modification of design
principles based upon functional ROMP initiators and terminators has
resulted in the first synthesis of main-chain heterotelechelic polymers
that self-assemble into A/B/C supramolecular triblock polymers composed
of orthogonal cyanuric acid-Hamilton wedge and SCS-Pd-II pincer-pyridine
motifs. Furthermore, supramolecular A/B/A triblock copolymers were
realized through the amalgamation of functionalized monomers, ROMP
initiators, and terminators. To date, this ROMP-fabricated system
represents the only known method to afford polymer main chains and side
chains studded with orthogonal motifs. We end by discussing the impetus
to attain functional materials via orthogonal self-assembly.
Collectively, our studies suggest that combining covalent and
noncovalent bonds in a well-defined and precise manner is an essential
design element to achieve complex architectures. The results discussed
in this Account illustrate the finesse associated with engineering
orthogonal interactions within supramolecular systems and are considered
essential steps toward developing complex biomimetic materials with high
precision and fidelity.},

Likewise, the HIV-1 Tat peptide, a cell-permeable peptide, has been successfully used for intracellular gene delivery. To improve the favorable properties of these two vectors, we combine PEI with the modified Tat peptide sequence bearing histidine and cysteine residues (mTat). Invitro mTat/PEI-mediated transfection was evaluated by luciferase expression plasmid in two cell types. mTat/PEI produced significant improvement (≈5-fold) in transfection efficiency of both cell lines with little cytotoxicity when compared to mTat alone, PEI alone, or four commercial reagents. The particle size of mTat/PEI/DNA complex was significantly smaller than mTat or PEI alone, and it was correlated with higher transfection efficiency. Filipin III, an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, significantly inhibited mTat/PEI transfection. In contrast, chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, did not. This suggested caveolae-mediated endocytosis as the transfection mechanism. Furthermore, the results of invivo studies showed that animals administered mTat/PEI/DNA intramuscularly had significantly higher and longer luciferase expression (≈7 months) than those with mTat/DNA, PEI/DNA, or DNA alone, without any associated toxicity.

Here we present a range of evidence, including the discovery of high-pressure phases never observed before in a CV3 chondrite, indicating that an impact shock generated a heterogeneous distribution of pressures and temperatures in which some portions reached at least 5GPa and 1,200 degrees C. The conditions were sufficient to melt Al-Cu-bearing minerals, which then rapidly solidified into icosahedrite and other Al-Cu metal phases. The meteorite also contains heretofore unobserved phases of iron-nickel and iron sulphide with substantial amounts of Al and Cu. The presence of these phases in Khatyrka provides further proof that the Al-Cu alloys are natural products of unusual processes that occurred in the early solar system.},

growing interest in the past decade ranging from fundamental synthesis

Our outreach program involved college mentors who participated in the development and implementation of chemistry lessons alongside the classroom teacher. Three technology-rich modules that focused on molecules, balancing equations, and nuclear chemistry were taught to high school students. Feedback-oriented and interactive lessons through apps with blogging were used to engage the students with the instructors as well as their peers. The combination of blogging with interactive apps increased student involvement and sustained their interests in the chemistry topics covered by the modules. The students were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental groups were required to use the blog, where students viewed the questions and uploaded their answers and comments. The control group did not have access to the blog during the modules. Performance, class participation, and interest in STEM fields by the groups were examined. The students received a personalized, interactive learning experience in chemistry, the college mentors gained teaching and mentoring experience, and the teacher received assistance in implementing technology in the classroom.

Its finding raised fundamental questions regarding the effects of pressure and temperature on the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the quasicrystal structure relative to possible isochemical crystalline or amorphous phases. Although several studies showed the stability at ambient temperature of synthetic icosahedral AlCuFe up to {\~{}}35 GPa, the simultaneous effect of temperature and pressure relevant for the formation of icosahedrite has been never investigated so far. Here we present in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments on synthetic icosahedral AlCuFe using multianvil device to explore possible temperature-induced phase transformations at pressures of 5 GPa and temperature up to 1773 K. Results show the structural stability of i-AlCuFe phase with a negligible effect of pressure on the volumetric thermal expansion properties. In addition, the structural analysis of the recovered sample excludes the transformation of AlCuFe quasicrystalline phase to possible approximant phases, which is in contrast with previous predictions at ambient pressure. Results from this study extend our knowledge on the stability of icosahedral AlCuFe at higher temperature and pressure than previously examined, and provide a new constraint on the stability of icosahedrite.},

dimensions using the Torquato-Jiao sequential linear programming
algorithm. The packings display a wide diversity of packing fractions,
average coordination numbers, and order as measured by standard scalar
order metrics. This geometric-structure approach enables us to show the
existence of relatively large maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings
with exactly isostatic jammed backbones and a packing fraction
(including rattlers) of phi = 0.826. By contrast, the concept of random
close packing (RCP) that identifies the most probable packings as the
most disordered misleadingly identifies highly ordered disk packings as
RCP in 2D. Fundamental structural descriptors such as the pair
correlation function, structure factor, and Voronoi statistics show a
strong contrast between the MRJ state and the typical hyperstatic,
polycrystalline packings with phi approximate to 0.88 that are more
commonly obtained using standard packing protocols. Establishing that
the MRJ state for monodisperse hard disks is isostatic and qualitatively
distinct from commonly observed polycrystalline packings contradicts
conventional wisdom that such a disordered, isostatic packing does not
exist due to a lack of geometrical frustration and sheds light on the
nature of disorder. This prompts the question of whether an algorithm
may be designed that is strongly biased toward generating the
monodisperse disk MRJ state.},

abstract = {A molecular framework based on guanidinium cations and 1,2,4,5-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)benzene (TSPB), an aromatic tetrasulfonate with nominal 2-fold and mirror symmetry, exhibits three crystallographically unique one-dimensional channels as a consequence of molecular symmetry and complementary hydrogen bonding between the guanidinium (G) ions and the sulfonate (S) groups of TSPB. Unlike previous GS frameworks, this new topology is sufficiently flexible to permit reversible release and adsorption of guest molecules in large single crystals through a cyclic shrinkage and expansion of the channels with retention of single crystallinity, as verified by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the G4TSPB framework permits guest exchange between various guest molecules through SCSCTs as well as exchange discrimination based on the size and character of the three different channels. The exchange of guest molecules during single crystal-single crystal transformations (SCSCT), a rare occurrence for hydrogen-bonded frameworks, is rather fast, with diffusivities of approximately 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1). Rapid diffusion in the two channels having cross sections sufficient to accommodate two guest molecules can be explained by two-way or ring diffusion, most likely vacancy assisted. Surprisingly, rapid guest exchange also is observed in a smaller channel having a cross-section that accommodates only one guest molecule, which can only be explained by guest-assisted single-file unidirectional diffusion. Several single crystals of inclusion compounds can be realized only through guest exchange in the intact framework, suggesting an approach to the synthesis of single crystalline inclusion compounds that otherwise cannot be attained through direct crystallization methods.},

We show here that reasonable assumptions about contact proliferation predict two distinct types of DST in the absence of inertia. The first occurs at densities above the jamming point of frictional particles; here, the thickened state is completely jammed and (unless particles deform) cannot flow without inhomogeneity or fracture. The second regime shows strain-rate hysteresis and arises at somewhat lower densities, where the thickened phase flows smoothly. DST is predicted to arise when finite-range repulsions defer contact formation until a characteristic stress level is exceeded.},

We show that this interaction between sphere and particle is short-range, occurring even for spheres smaller than the particle length, and for a variety of sphere materials. We consider a simple model, based on lubrication theory, of a force- and torque-free swimmer driven by a surface slip (the phoretic propulsion mechanism) and moving near a solid surface. The model demonstrates capture, or movement towards the surface, and yields speeds independent of distance. This study reveals the crucial aspects of activity-driven interactions of self-propelled particles with passive objects, and brings into question the use of colloidal tracers as probes of active matter.},

abstract = {We characterize the structure of maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings by computing the Minkowski functionals (volume, surface area, and integrated mean curvature) of their associated Voronoi cells. The probability distribution functions of these functionals of Voronoi cells in MRJ sphere packings are qualitatively similar to those of an equilibrium hard-sphere liquid and partly even to the uncorrelated Poisson point process, implying that such local statistics are relatively structurally insensitive. This is not surprising because the Minkowski functionals of a single Voronoi cell incorporate only local information and are insensitive to global structural information. To improve upon this, we introduce descriptors that incorporate nonlocal information via the correlation functions of the Minkowski functionals of two cells at a given distance as well as certain cell-cell probability density functions. We evaluate these higher-order functions for our MRJ packings as well as equilibrium hard spheres and the Poisson point process. It is shown that these Minkowski correlation and density functions contain visibly more information than the corresponding standard pair-correlation functions. We find strong anticorrelations in the Voronoi volumes for the hyperuniform MRJ packings, consistent with previous findings for other pair correlations {\{}[{\}}A. Donev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 090604 (2005)], indicating that large-scale volume fluctuations are suppressed by accompanying large Voronoi cells with small cells, and vice versa. In contrast to the aforementioned local Voronoi statistics, the correlation functions of the Voronoi cells qualitatively distinguish the structure of MRJ sphere packings (prototypical glasses) from that of not only the Poisson point process but also the correlated equilibrium hard-sphere liquids. Moreover, while we did not find any perfect icosahedra (the locally densest possible structure in which a central sphere contacts 12 neighbors) in the MRJ packings, a preliminary Voronoi topology analysis indicates the presence of strongly distorted icosahedra.},

applied. Although such materials are ubiquitous and relevant for
industry, there is no accepted microscopic description of how they
yield, even in the simplest situations in which temperature is
negligible and in which flow inhomogeneities such as shear bands or
fractures are absent. Here we propose a scaling description of the
yielding transition in amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero
temperature. Our description makes a connection between the
Herschel-Bulkley exponent characterizing the singularity of the flow
curve near the yield stress Sigma(c),the extension and duration of the
avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density P(x) of
soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function of the stress
increment x beyond which they yield. We argue that the critical
exponents of the yielding transition may be expressed in terms of three
independent exponents, theta, d(f), and z, characterizing, respectively,
the density of soft spots, the fractal dimension of the avalanches, and
their duration. Our description shares some similarity with the
depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven
through a random potential, but also presents some striking differences.
We test our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton model
similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction
kernel, and find satisfying agreement with our predictions in both two

abstract = {Maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packing is a prototypical example of a system naturally poised at the margin between underconstraint and overconstraint. This marginal stability has traditionally been understood in terms of isostaticity, the equality of the number of mechanical contacts and the number of degrees of freedom. Quasicontacts, pairs of spheres on the verge of coming in contact, are irrelevant for static stability, but they come into play when considering dynamic stability, as does the distribution of contact forces. We show that the effects of marginal dynamic stability, as manifested in the distributions of quasicontacts and weak contacts, are consequential and nontrivial. We study these ideas first in the context of MRJ packing of d-dimensional spheres, where we show that the abundance of quasicontacts grows at a faster rate than that of contacts. We reexamine a calculation of Jin et al. (Phys. Rev. E 82, 051126, 2010), where quasicontacts were originally neglected, and we explore the effect of their inclusion in the calculation. This analysis yields an estimate of the asymptotic behavior of the packing density in high dimensions. We argue that this estimate should be reinterpreted as a lower bound. The latter part of the paper is devoted to Bravais lattice packings that possess the minimum number of contacts to maintain mechanical stability. We show that quasicontacts play an even more important role in these packings. We also show that jammed lattices are a useful setting for studying the Edwards ensemble, which weights each mechanically stable configuration equally and does not account for dynamics.

Two-patch particles, with two patches on opposite sides of the particle (2-fold symmetry) pack into the cmm plane group and 3D packings with I4mm space group symmetry, in contrast to uncharged spherical or ellipsoidal colloids that typically crystallize into a face-centered ABC layer packing. Three-patch particles (3-fold symmetry) form chains having a 21 screw axis symmetry, but these chains pair in a manner such that each individual chain has one-fold symmetry but the pair has 21 screw axis symmetry, in an arrangement that aligns the patches that would favor Coulombic interactions along the chain.

Larger 2D domains of the three-patch particles crystallize in the p6m plane group with alignment (with respect to the field) and packing densities that suggest random disorder in the domains, whereas four-patch particles form 2D domains in which close-packed rows are aligned with the field. Colloidal particles equipped with two, three, or four negatively charged patches, which endow the particles with 2-fold, 3-fold, or tetrahedral symmetries, form 1D chains, 2D layers, and 3D packings when polarized by an AC electric field. Two-patch particles, with two patches on opposite sides of the particle (2-fold symmetry) pack into the cmm plane group and 3D packings with I4mm space group symmetry, in contrast to uncharged spherical or ellipsoidal colloids that typically crystallize into a face-centered ABC layer packing. Three-patch particles (3-fold symmetry) form chains having a 21 screw axis symmetry, but these chains pair in a manner such that each individual chain has one-fold symmetry but the pair has 21 screw axis symmetry, in an arrangement that aligns the patches that would favor Coulombic interactions along the chain.

abstract = {Two-dimensional colloidal crystals confined within electric field traps on the surface of a dielectrophoretic cell undergo reversible phase transitions that depend on the strength of the applied AC electric field. At low field strengths, the particles adopt a two-dimensional hexagonal close-packed lattice with p6m plane group symmetry and the maximum achievable packing fraction of $\phi$ = 0.91. Higher electric field strengths induce dipoles in the particles that provoke a phase transition to structures that depend on the number of particles confined in the trap. Whereas traps containing N = 24 particles transform to a square-packed lattice with p4m symmetry and $\phi$ = 0.79 is observed, traps of the same size containing N = 23 particles can also pack in a lattice with p2 symmetry and $\phi$ = 0.66. Traps with N = 21, 22, and 25 particles exhibit a mixture of packing structures, revealing the influence of lateral compressive forces, in addition to induced dipole interactions, in stabilizing loosely packed arrangements. These observations permit construction of a phase diagram based on adjustable parameters of electric field strength (0-750 V/cm) and particle number (N = 21-25).},

abstract = {The role of conformational flexibility in topological enforcement of several crystalline materials based on hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional guanidinium-sulfonate (GS) networks is demonstrated by using a series of organopolysulfonates that prompt the formation of either lamellar or cylindrical architectures. Whereas flexible organopolysulfonate linkers decorated with flexible arms self-assemble into lamellar architectures, rigid organopolysulfonates linkers enforce the formation of hydrogen-bonded cylinders with intercylinder spacing governed by the size of the linker. Specifically, hexagonal cylindrical structures generated from trisulfonates with three-fold molecular symmetry are the topological equivalent of the cylindrical hexagonal phases reported previously for guanidinium organomonosulfonate inclusion compounds, but neighboring cylinders are now connected through covalent nodes provided by the trisulfonates rather than dispersive interactions between the arene rings of the organomonosulfonates. Organopolysulfonates with moderate conformational freedom, however, can generate both lamellar and cylindrical structures, depending on the guest molecules encapsulated by the host framework. These observations illustrate that the crystal architecture (i.e., lamellar vs cylindrical) and the shape of GS cylinders can be regulated in a predictable way by the molecular symmetries and conformational constraints of the organopolysulfonates building blocks.},

abstract = {Microtubules and motor proteins self-organize into biologically important assemblies including the mitotic spindle and the centrosomal microtubule array. Outside of cells, microtubule-motor mixtures can form novel active liquid-crystalline materials driven out of equilibrium by adenosine triphosphate-consuming motor proteins. Microscopic motor activity causes polarity-dependent interactions between motor proteins and microtubules, but how these interactions yield larger-scale dynamical behavior such as complex flows and defect dynamics is not well understood. We develop a multiscale theory for microtubule-motor systems in which Brownian dynamics simulations of polar microtubules driven by motors are used to study microscopic organization and stresses created by motor-mediated microtubule interactions. We identify polarity-sorting and crosslink tether relaxation as two polar-specific sources of active destabilizing stress. We then develop a continuum Doi-Onsager model that captures polarity sorting and the hydrodynamic flows generated by these polar-specific active stresses. In simulations of active nematic flows on immersed surfaces, the active stresses drive turbulent flow dynamics and continuous generation and annihilation of disclination defects. The dynamics follow from two instabilities, and accounting for the immersed nature of the experiment yields unambiguous characteristic length and time scales. When turning off the hydrodynamics in the Doi-Onsager model, we capture formation of polar lanes as observed in the Brownian dynamics simulation.},

abstract = {Maximally random jammed (MRJ) particle packings can be viewed as prototypical glasses in that they are maximally disordered while simultaneously being mechanically rigid. The prediction of the MRJ packing density ϕMRJ, among other packing properties of frictionless particles, still poses many theoretical challenges, even for congruent spheres or disks. Using the geometric-structure approach, we derive for the first time a highly accurate formula for MRJ densities for a very wide class of two-dimensional frictionless packings, namely, binary convex superdisks, with shapes that continuously interpolate between circles and squares. By incorporating specific attributes of MRJ states and a novel organizing principle, our formula yields predictions of ϕMRJ that are in excellent agreement with corresponding computer-simulation estimates in almost the entire $\alpha$-x plane with semi-axis ratio $\alpha$ and small-particle relative number concentration x. Importantly, in the monodisperse circle limit, the predicted ϕMRJ = 0.834 agrees very well with the very recently numerically discovered MRJ density of 0.827, which distinguishes it from high-density "random-close packing" polycrystalline states and hence provides a stringent test on the theory. Similarly, for non-circular monodisperse superdisks, we predict MRJ states with densities that are appreciably smaller than is conventionally thought to be achievable by standard packing protocols.},

Recent efforts have focused on developing artificial systems that can mimic microorganisms, in particular their self-propulsion. We report on the design and characterization of synthetic self-propelled particles that migrate upstream, known as positive rheotaxis. This phenomenon results from a purely physical mechanism involving the interplay between the polarity of the particles and their alignment by a viscous torque. We show quantitative agreement between experimental data and a simple model of an overdamped Brownian pendu- lum. The model notably predicts the existence of a stagnation point in a diverging flow. We take advantage of this property to demonstrate that our active particles can sense and predictably organize in an imposed flow. Our colloidal system represents an important step toward the realization of biomimetic microsystems with the ability to sense and respond to environmental changes.},

derivatives display crystal architectures in which the stilbenes serve
as pillars that connect opposing guanidinium sulfonate (GS) sheets in a
continuously layered architecture while guiding the organization of the
stilbene residues into packing motifs that produce unique optical
properties. The constraints imposed by ortho-substitution result in a
heretofore unreported topology of the pillars projecting from the
two-dimensional GS sheet, while the dense packing of stilbene
constituents, confined between the GS sheets, results in strong
intermolecular electronic coupling. Stilbene 420 (2,2
`'-({\{}[{\}}1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diyldi-2,1-ethenediyl)bis-benzenesulfonate)
pillars pack in a face-to-face brickwork motif, producing a large
bathochromic shift (similar to 100 nm) of the absorbance and emission
spectra relative to stilbene 420 in methanol. The

pillars, which pack in a face-to-face herringbone motif between the GS

absorption spectrum, indicative of an unusually large Davydov splitting.
The observation of both bathochromic and hypsochromic shifts can be
attributed to the herringbone arrangement, in which both transitions are
allowed due to the nonzero vector sum of the transition dipoles in both
states. The large magnitude of the Davydov splitting reflects the strong
intermolecular coupling between the chromophores, enforced by
confinement in the GS framework. The newly discovered GS architectures
evoke a new design rule that permits prediction of GS topologies in the
case of longer tetris-shaped pillars.},

highly plastic regions form elongated structures that are especially
apparent near the maximal shear stress Sigma(max) where failure occurs.
This observation suggested that Sigma(max) acts as a critical point
where the length scale of those structures diverges, possibly causing
macroscopic transient shear bands. Here, we argue instead that the
entire solid phase (Sigma {\textless} Sigma(max)) is critical, that plasticity
always involves system-spanning events, and that their magnitude
diverges at Sigma(max) independently of the presence of shear bands. We
relate the statistics and fractal properties of these rearrangements to
an exponent theta that captures the stability of the material, which is
observed to vary continuously with stress, and we confirm our
predictions in elastoplastic models.},

abstract = {Women made many early and outstanding contributions to X-ray crystallography at a time when they were excluded from most other branches of physical science. The etiology of this bright spot in the social evolution of science is sought in early childhood education, especially the Froebel kindergarten that was rooted in symmetry and lattice building exercises. This connection is explored through the formative educational experiences of eight crystallographers that are compared with those of eight astronomers. Associations with Froebel's pedagogy are ubiquitous in the biographies of the crystallographers and wholly absent in the biographies of astronomers. Creating a more democratic scientific enterprise requires understanding the mechanisms for increasing the participation of members of unrepresented genders and ethnicities. Some of these mechanisms may be found in history. One of the crystallographers profiled, Isabel Ellie Knaggs (1893-1981), made a major contribution to the X-ray analysis of organic compounds by establishing that carbon atoms in isolated molecules adopt tetrahedral coordination geometries. This determination was a capstone on the stereochemistry of the preceding 50 years. Another scientist, working independently, exclusively claimed this discovery. Thus, while studying the general disenfranchisement of women in science, a particular injustice not heretofore recognized came into focus.},

We propose that these contractions are driven by the clustering of microtubule minus ends by dynein. Based on this idea, we construct an active fluid theory of network contractions, which predicts a dependence of the timescale of contraction on initial network geometry, a development of density inhomogeneities during contraction, a constant final network density, and a strong influence of dynein inhibition on the rate of contraction, all in quantitative agreement with experiments. These results demonstrate that the motor-driven clustering of filament ends is a generic mechanism leading to contraction.},

abstract = {Despite an absence of conventional porosity, the 1D coordination polymer
{\{}[{\}}Ag-4(O2C(CF2)(2)CF3)(4)(TMP)(3)] (1; TMP=tetramethylpyrazine) can
absorb small alcohols from the vapour phase, which insert into AgO bonds
to yield coordination polymers
{\{}[{\}}Ag-4(O2C(CF2)(2)CF3)(4)(TMP)(3)(ROH)(2)] (1-ROH; R=Me, Et, iPr). The
reactions are reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal
transformations. Vapour-solid equilibria have been examined by gas-phase
IR spectroscopy (K=5.68(9)x10(-5) (MeOH), 9.5(3)x10(-6) (EtOH),
6.14(5)x10(-5) (iPrOH) at 295K, 1bar). Thermal analyses (TGA, DSC) have
enabled quantitative comparison of two-step reactions 1-ROH12, in which
2 is the 2D coordination polymer {\{}[{\}}Ag-4(O2C(CF2)(2)CF3)(4)(TMP)(2)]
formed by loss of TMP ligands exclusively from singly-bridging sites.
Four polymorphic forms of 1 (1-A(LT), 1-A(HT), 1-B-LT and 1-B-HT;
HT=high temperature, LT=low temperature) have been identified
crystallographically. In situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies of
the 1-ROH12 transformations indicate the role of the HT polymorphs in
these reactions. The structural relationship between polymorphs,
involving changes in conformation of perfluoroalkyl chains and a change
in orientation of entire polymers (A versus B forms), suggests a
mechanism for the observed reactions and a pathway for guest transport
within the fluorous layers. Consistent with this pathway, optical
microscopy and AFM studies on single crystals of 1-MeOH/1-A(HT) show
that cracks parallel to the layers of interdigitated perfluoroalkyl
chains develop during the MeOH release/uptake process.},

In an effort to elucidate the crystallization of L-cystine and the mode of action of tailored growth inhibitors that may constitute effective therapies, real-time in situ atomic force microscopy has been used to investigate the surface micromorphology and growth kinetics of the {\{}0001{\}} faces of L-cystine at various supersaturations and concentrations of the growth inhibitor L-cystine dimethylester (CDME). Crystal growth is actuated by screw dislocations on the {\{}0001{\}} L-cystine surface, producing hexagonal spiral hillocks that are a consequence of six interlacing spirals of anisotropic molecular layers. The high level of elastic stress in the immediate vicinity around the dislocation line results in a decrease in the step velocities and a corresponding increase in the spacing of steps. The kinetic curves acquired in the presence of CDME conform to the classical CabreraVermilyea model. Anomalous birefringence in the {\{}10 (1) over bar0{\}} growth sectors, combined with computational modeling, supports a high fidelity of stereospecific binding of CDME, in a unique orientation, exclusively at one of the six crystallographically unique projections on the {\{}10 (1) over bar0{\}} plane.},

abstract = {Hyperuniformity characterizes a state of matter for which (scaled)
density fluctuations diminish towards zero at the largest length scales.
However, the task of determining whether or not an image of an
experimental system is hyperuniform is experimentally challenging due to
finite-resolution, noise, and sample-size effects that influence
characterization measurements. Here we explore these issues, employing
video optical microscopy to study hyperuniformity phenomena in
disordered two-dimensional jammed packings of soft spheres. Using a
combination of experiment and simulation we characterize the possible
adverse effects of particle polydispersity, image noise, and finite-size
effects on the assignment of hyperuniformity, and we develop a
methodology that permits improved diagnosis of hyperuniformity from
real-space measurements. The key to this improvement is a simple packing
reconstruction algorithm that incorporates particle polydispersity to
minimize the free volume. In addition, simulations show that
hyperuniformity in finite-sized samples can be ascertained more
accurately in direct space than in reciprocal space. Finally, our
experimental colloidal packings of soft polymeric spheres are shown to
be effectively hyperuniform.},

The mechanics of this process was studied for vapor grown needle-like crystals of N-benzoylglycine (hippuric acid) and N-(2-thienylcarbonyl)glycine, and analyzed by phenomenological models. The elastic stress at the crystal tip undergoes plastic relaxation leading to the twisting deformations. As the crystal grows and thickens it partially untwists showing linear increases of the twist period with crystal thickness. Such behavior was simulated with a model that assumes the constant density of defects in successive growth layers. However, transmission electron microscopy does not reveal any dislocations or other extended defects typically associated with plastic deformation. Published data on other materials show the linear dependencies of pitch on thickness suggesting comparable untwisting mechanisms for different materials.},

Bulk packings with solid volume fraction between phi = 0.54 and phi = 0.634 were computer-generated using experimentally determined particle size distributions characterized by different mean particle diameter and associated standard deviation. The parameter sigma(2) was calculated from two-and three-point correlation functions S-2 and S-3, respectively, via an approach based on sampling templates. Results of the asymptotic analysis for S-2 and S-3 compare favorably with theoretical predictions. Effective diffusivities calculated by the approximate analytical formula are close to those obtained from simulations using a random-walk particle-tracking technique. The values of D-eff are affected by the packings' solid volume fraction, the spatial positions of the spheres, and to a far lesser extent by the particles' polydispersity. The proposed numerical approach can be applied to evaluate effective diffusive transport properties of general two-phase materials just from the geometrical information embodied in phi and sigma(2).

abstract = {Marginal stability is the notion that stability is achieved, but only barely so. This property constrains the ensemble of configurations explored at low temperature in a variety of systems, including spin, electron, and structural glasses. A key feature of marginal states is a (saturated) pseudogap in the distribution of soft excitations. We examine how such pseudogaps appear dynamically by studying the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass. After revisiting and correcting the multi-spin-flip criterion for local stability, we show that stationarity along the hysteresis loop requires soft spins to be frustrated among each other, with a correlation diverging as C(lambda) similar to 1/lambda, where lambda is the stability of the more stable spin. We explain how this arises spontaneously in a marginal system and develop an analogy between the spin dynamics in the SK model and random walks in two dimensions. We discuss analogous frustrations among soft excitations in short range glasses and how to detect them experimentally. We also show how these findings apply to hard sphere packings.},

We show that, while the overall similarity of their shape to that of hard oblate ellipsoids is reflected in a qualitatively similar phase diagram, differences are more pronounced in the high-density crystal phase up to the densest-known packings determined here. In contrast to those non-(Bravais)-lattice two-particle basis crystals that are the densest-known packings of hard (oblate) ellipsoids, hard convex lens-shaped particles pack more densely in two types of degenerate crystalline structures: (i) non-(Bravais)-lattice two-particle basis body-centered-orthorhombic-like crystals and (ii) (Bravais) lattice monoclinic crystals. By stacking at will, regularly or irregularly, laminae of these two crystals, infinitely degenerate, generally non-periodic in the stacking direction, dense packings can be constructed that are consistent with recent organizing principles. While deferring the assessment of which of these dense ordered structures is thermodynamically stable in the high-density crystalline solid regime, the degeneracy of their densest-known packings strongly suggests that colloidal convex lens-shaped particles could be better glass formers than colloidal spheres because of the additional rotational degrees of freedom.},

exclusion(2-4)) interactions, both attractive, leads to a re-entrant
regime where the colloids are dispersed and form solids both on heating
and on cooling. We provide a simple model to explain the observed
transitions and to fill the theoretical gap at the polymer-adsorption
crossover(2,9). Our findings open possibilities for colloidal
self-assembly(5,13), the formation of colloidal crystals(14,15) and

In the presence of an interface with a conducting aqueous phase, image-charge effects lead to strong binding of colloidal particles to the interface, even though the particles are wetted very little by the aqueous phase. We study both the behavior of individual colloidal particles as they approach the interface and the interactions between particles that are already interfacially bound. We demonstrate that using particles which are minimally wetted by the aqueous phase allows us to isolate and study those interactions which are due solely to charging of the particle surface in oil.

inertial flows whose scaling properties clearly differ from frictionless

abstract = {The regulation of cell-cell adhesion is important in cell motility, tissue growth, and for the mechanical integrity of tissues. Although the role of active cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating cadherin interactions is crucial in vivo, here we present a biomimetic emulsion system to characterize the passive E-cadherin-mediated adhesion between droplets. The visualization of a three-dimensional assembly of lipid droplets, functionalized with extracellular E-cadherin domains, reveals a hierarchy of homophilic interactions. First, the high interfacial tension of droplets facilitates trans cadherin-cadherin adhesion, which is strong enough to stabilize looser than random close packing configurations. Second, fluorescence enhancement shows that adding clustering agents, such as calcium or chelating ligands, favor the lateral cis adhesion of the already bound cadherin pairs over the clustering of monomer cadherin on the surface. Finally, above a threshold cadherin and calcium concentration, the cis and trans protein interactions become strong enough to trigger and promote droplet fusion. While E-cadherin is not known to participate in cellular fusion, this mechanism is general because replacing calcium with cholesterol to cluster the cadherin-carrying lipids also promotes fusion. These results suggest that passive clustering, via calcium-induced dimerization or membrane ordering, may contribute to the reinforcement of cell-cell contacts. Alternatively, a molecular switch for fusion offers a route to mixing droplet contents and controlling their size in situ.},

abstract = {We develop a rigid multiblob method for numerically solving the mobility problem for suspensions of passive and active rigid particles of complex shape in Stokes flow in unconfined, partially confined, and fully confined geometries. As in a number of existing methods, we discretize rigid bodies using a collection of minimally resolved spherical blobs constrained to move as a rigid body, to arrive at a potentially large linear system of equations for the unknown Lagrange multipliers and rigid-body motions. Here we develop a block-diagonal preconditioner for this linear system and show that a standard Krylov solver converges in a modest number of iterations that is essentially independent of the number of particles. Key to the efficiency of the method is a technique for fast computation of the product of the blob-blob mobility matrix and a vector. For unbounded suspensions, we rely on existing analytical expressions for the Rotne–Prager–Yamakawa tensor combined with a fast multipole method (FMM) to obtain linear scaling in the number of particles. For suspensions sedimented against a single no-slip boundary, we use a direct summation on a graphical processing unit (GPU), which gives quadratic asymptotic scaling with the number of particles. For fully confined domains, such as periodic suspensions or suspensions confined in slit and square channels, we extend a recently developed rigid-body immersed boundary method by B. Kallemov, A. P. S. Bhalla, B. E. Griffith, and A. Donev (Commun. Appl. Math. Comput. Sci. 11 (2016), no. 1, 79–141) to suspensions of freely moving passive or active rigid particles at zero Reynolds number. We demonstrate that the iterative solver for the coupled fluid and rigid-body equations converges in a bounded number of iterations regardless of the system size. In our approach, each iteration only requires a few cycles of a geometric multigrid solver for the Poisson equation, and an application of the block-diagonal preconditioner, leading to linear scaling with the number of particles. We optimize a number of parameters in the iterative solvers and apply our method to a variety of benchmark problems to carefully assess the accuracy of the rigid multiblob approach as a function of the resolution. We also model the dynamics of colloidal particles studied in recent experiments, such as passive boomerangs in a slit channel, as well as a pair of non-Brownian active nanorods sedimented against a wall.},

abstract = {Drug-induced calculi account for 1–2{\%} of all renal calculi, posing a threat to human health and hindering the development of effective therapies, particularly those based on drug compounds with low solubility. Recently reported compounds from a screening library of P2X3 receptor antagonists are promising candidates for non-opioid treatment of chronic pain, but they can be poorly soluble in aqueous media, as is evident from the formation of crystals in renal and infrarenal structures of rats (a.k.a. “xenostones”). This behavior prompted an investigation using real-time in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) to elucidate the crystal growth modes and the effect of tailor-made additives chosen from structural analogues in the screening library, which serve as “molecular imposters” that inhibit crystal growth through specific binding to crystal sites on the actively growing surface. Using a readily available member (denoted as DAPSA) of the P2X3 receptor antagonist family having an aryloxydiaminopyrimidine backbone as an illustrative example, in situ AFM of the morphologically significant (011) surface revealed dislocation-actuated growth spirals with an anisotropic morphology. This behavior can be attributed to the nonuniform rate of solute attachment to eight crystallographically unique steps of the spiral, a direct consequence of the dissymmetry of this crystal surface. Eighteen molecular imposters that share the aryloxydiaminopyrimidine backbone of DAPSA were selected from the screening library to systematically investigate the roles of imposter substituent position, size, and functionality on the step velocities along the eight unique crystallographic directions. A nonuniform reduction in step velocities was observed, signaling site discrimination of imposter binding that can be attributed to stereochemical recognition of the imposters at specific crystal sites. The anisotropy of growth inhibition observed in the presence of the various imposters is consistent with binding energies calculated for the 32 crystallographically unique kink sites on steps advancing along predominant growth directions. These results provide insight into the design of growth inhibitors for molecular crystalline solids with complex and dissymmetric surfaces while also suggesting a strategy for formulations containing congeners that can prevent harmful crystal growth in human renal structures.},

We present the preparation of well-defined (pyridine-pyrrolyl)Ni monomethyl and monophenyl complexes that allow the direct observation of bimolecular reductive elimination to generate ethane and biphenyl, respectively. The sp(3)-sp(3) and sp(2)-sp(2) couplings proceed via two distinct pathways. Oxidants promote the fast formation of Ni(III) from (pyridine-pyrrolyl)Ni-methyl, which dimerizes to afford a bimetallic Ni(III) intermediate. Our data are most consistent with the subsequent methyl coupling from the bimetallic Ni(III) to generate ethane as the rate-determining step. In contrast, the formation of biphenyl is facilitated by the coordination of a bidentate donor ligand.},

abstract = {Thin film epitaxy typically invokes a superposition of a pair of rigid
two-dimensional lattices with a well-defined orientation governed by
some form of commensurism. A report by Meissner et al. in this issue of
ACS Nano demonstrates that the organization of organic molecules on
substrates may not be that simple, as static distortion waves involving
miniscule shifts of atomic positions from substrate lattice points can
lead to orientations of a molecular film that cannot be described by
often used models. Herein, we provide some highlights of epitaxy, with a
focus on configurations that reflect the delicate balance between
intermolecular interactions within a molecular film and
molecule-substrate interactions. Although geometric models for
explaining and predicting epitaxial configurations can be used to guide
synthesis of materials, their use must recognize energetic factors and
the possibility of more complex, and possibly less predictable,
interface structures.},

abstract = {Most battery positive electrodes operate with a 3d transition-metal (TM)
reaction centre. A direct and quantitative probe of the TM states upon
electrochemical cycling is valuable for understanding the detailed
cycling mechanism and charge diffusion in the electrodes, which is
related with many practical parameters of a battery. This review
includes a comprehensive summary of our recent demonstrations of five
different types of quantitative analysis of the TM states in battery
electrodes based on soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy and multiplet
calculations. In LiFePO4, a system of a well-known two-phase
transformation type, the TM redox could be strictly determined through a
simple linear combination of the two end-members. In Mn-based compounds,
the Mn states could also be quantitatively evaluated, but a set of
reference spectra with all the three possible Mn valences needs to be
deliberately selected and considered in the fitting. Although the
fluorescence signals suffer the self-absorption distortion, the
multiplet calculations could consider the distortion effect, which
allows a quantitative determination of the overall Ni oxidation state in
the bulk. With the aid of multiplet calculations, one could also achieve
a quasi-quantitative analysis of the Co redox evolution in LiCoO2 based
on the energy position of the spectroscopic peak. The benefit of
multiplet calculations is more important for studying electrode
materials with TMs of mixed spin states, as exemplified by the
quantitative analysis of the mixed spin Na2-xFe2(CN)(6) system. At the
end, we showcase that such quantitative analysis could provide valuable
information for optimizing the electrochemical performance of Na0.44MnO2
electrodes for Na-ion batteries. The methodology summarized in this
review could be extended to other energy application systems with TM
redox centre for detailed analysis, for example, fuel cell and catalytic
materials.},

abstract = {The sixth blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP)
methods has been held, with five target systems: a small nearly rigid
molecule, a polymorphic former drug candidate, a chloride salt hydrate,
a co-crystal and a bulky flexible molecule. This blind test has seen
substantial growth in the number of participants, with the broad range
of prediction methods giving a unique insight into the state of the art
in the field. Significant progress has been seen in treating flexible
molecules, usage of hierarchical approaches to ranking structures, the
application of density-functional approximations, and the establishment
of new workflows and `best practices' for performing CSP calculations.
All of the targets, apart from a single potentially disordered Z' = 2
polymorph of the drug candidate, were predicted by at least one
submission. Despite many remaining challenges, it is clear that CSP
methods are becoming more applicable to a wider range of real systems,
including salts, hydrates and larger flexible molecules. The results
also highlight the potential for CSP calculations to complement and

Using optical microscopy and scanning ion-conductance microscopy in combination, the dissolution rate of individual crystallographically independent crystal faces can be measured quantitatively while providing a direct visualization of the evolution of crystal morphology in real time in three dimensions. Finite element method models using experimental data enables quantitative analysis of dissolution fluxes for individual faces and determination of the limiting process—mass transport or interfacial kinetics—that regulates dissolution. A key feature of the approach is that isolated crystals (typically {\textless}60 $\mu$m largest characteristic dimension) in solution during dissolution experience high and well-defined diffusion rates. The ability to obtain this quantitative information for individual crystal faces suggests a pathway to understanding crystal dissolution at the molecular level and regulating bioavailability, for example, through manipulation of crystal morphology.},

abstract = {Flows of hard granular materials depend strongly on the interparticle
friction coefficient mu(p) and on the inertial number I, which
characterizes proximity to the jamming transition where flow stops.
Guided by numerical simulations, we derive the phase diagram of dense
inertial flow of spherical particles, finding three regimes for 10(-4)
less than or similar to I less than or similar to 10(-1): frictionless,
frictional sliding, and rolling. These are distinguished by the dominant
means of energy dissipation, changing from collisional to sliding
friction, and back to collisional, as mu(p) increases from zero at
constant I. The three regimes differ in their kinetics and rheology; in
particular, the velocity fluctuations and the stress ratio both display
nonmonotonic behavior with mu(p), corresponding to transitions between
the three regimes of flow. We rationalize the phase boundaries between
these regimes, show that energy balance yields scaling relations between
microscopic properties in each of them, and derive the strain scale
atwhich particles lose memory of their velocity. For the frictional
sliding regime most relevant experimentally, we find for I {\textgreater}= 10(-2.5)
that the growth of the macroscopic friction mu(I) with I is induced by
an increase of collisional dissipation. This implies in that range that
mu(I) - mu(0) similar to I1-2b, where b approximate to 0.2 is an
exponent that characterizes both the dimensionless velocity fluctuations
L similar to I-b and the density of sliding contacts chi similar to I-b.},

Here we apply our crystal structure prediction procedure and the enhanced molecular dynamics based sampling approach called the Crystal-Adiabatic Free Energy Dynamics (Crystal-AFED) method to benzene and naphthalene. Crystal-AFED allows the free energy landscape of structures to be explored efficiently at any desired temperature and pressure. For each system, we successfully predict the most stable crystal structures at atmospheric pressure and explore the relative Gibbs free energies of predicted polymorphs at high pressures. Using Crystal-AFED sampling, we find that mixed structures, which typically cannot be discovered by standard crystal structure prediction methods, are prevalent in the solid forms of these compounds at high pressure.},

abstract = {Important aspects of collective behaviour in granular media, such as
formation of force chains and shear localisation, are related to
kinematics at the underlying particle scale. Particle kinematics
consists of translation and rotation. While considerable effort has been
dedicated to resolving the translational component of particle
displacements, rotational components have received less attention that
is due partly to the difficulty associated with distinguishing rotation
from translation at the particle scale. In this paper, three new methods
based on digital image correlation, image registration and point
least-square estimation are introduced to quantify planar particle
rotation. The underlying theory behind each method is described and the
performance of the methods is assessed through detailed error analysis.
The strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed based on their
applicability to study particle kinematics in natural sand. The methods
are presented in the form of open-source codes that can be integrated
with other analytical tools to investigate particle kinematics. The
application of the three methods is demonstrated through the study of
particle rotation in plane strain assemblies of granular media under
active and passive conditions.},

abstract = {The formation of crystal aggregates, one of the critical processes in kidney stone pathogenesis, involves interactions between crystals (predominantly calcium oxalate monohydrate, COM) and urinary constituents (e.g., proteins), which serve as an adhesive ``glue'' between crystals in stones. To develop a better understanding of the protein--crystal interactions that lead to crystal aggregation, we have measured the effect of model proteins on bulk COM crystal properties as well as their adsorption on crystal surfaces using three synthetic polyanions: poly(aspartic acid) (polyD), poly(glutamic acid) (polyE), and poly(acrylic acid) (polyAA). These anionic macromolecules reduced the amount of COM crystal aggregation in bulk solution to an extent similar to that observed for mixture of proteins from normal urine, with little difference between the polymers. In contrast, the polymers exhibited differences in measures of COM crystal growth. Polycations such as poly(arginine) (polyR) and poly(lysine) (polyK) reduced aggregation weakly and exerted negligible effects on crystal growth. All polyions were found to associate with COM crystal surfaces, as evidenced by changes in the zeta potential of COM crystals in electrophoretic mobility measurements. On the other hand, COM aggregation and possibly growth can be promoted by many binary mixtures of polycations and polyanions, which appeared to be mediated by polymer aggregate formation rather than loss of crystal charge stabilization. Similarly, crystal aggregation promotion behavior can be driven by forming aggregates of weakly charged polyanions, like Tamm--Horsfall protein, suggesting that polymer (protein) aggregation may play a critical role in stone formation. Sensitivity of polyanion--COM crystal surface interactions to the chemical composition of polymer side groups were demonstrated by large differences in crystal aggregation behavior between polyD and polyE, which correlated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of growth inhibition on various COM surfaces and chemical force microscopy (CFM) measurements of unbinding forces between COM crystal surfaces and AFM tips decorated with either carboxylate or amidinium moieties (mimicking polyanion and polyR side chains, respectively). The lack of strong interaction for polyE at the COM (100) surface compared to polyD appeared to be the critical difference. Finally, the simultaneous presence of polyanions and polycations appeared to alter the ability of polycations to mediate unbinding forces in CFM and promote crystal growth. In summary, polyanions strongly associated with COM surfaces and influenced crystallization, while polycations did not, though important differences were observed based on the physicochemical properties of polyanions. Observations suggest that COM aggregation with both polyanion--polycation mixtures and weakly charged polyanions is promoted by polymer aggregate formation, which plays a critical role in bridging crystal surfaces.},

An Eyring plot for $\beta$-hydride elimination–olefin rotation–reinsertion is constructed from variable-temperature NMR spectra with 13C-labeled agostic complexes. The enthalpy of activation ($\Delta$H≠) for $\beta$-H elimination is 13.2 kcal mol−1.

abstract = {The theory of photokinetic effects expresses the forces and torques exerted by a beam of light in terms of experimentally accessible amplitude and phase profiles. We use this formalism to develop an intuitive explanation for the performance of optical tweezers operating in the Rayleigh regime, including effects arising from the influence of light{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s angular momentum. First-order dipole contributions reveal how a focused beam can trap small objects, and what features limit the trap{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s stability. The first-order force separates naturally into a conservative intensity-gradient term that forms a trap and a non-conservative solenoidal term that drives the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Neither term depends on the light{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s polarization; light{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s spin angular momentum plays no role at dipole order. Polarization-dependent effects, such as trap-strength anisotropy and spin-curl forces, are captured by the second-order dipole-interference contribution to the photokinetic force.

The results indicate that silica sand and coral sand exhibit different rate dependency in terms of stiffness and peak normal stress. In general, strain rate effects are highly dependent on confining stress and relative density, with dense samples subjected to the highest employed confining stress exhibiting the most pronounced effects to variation in strain rates.

However, when measuring particle motion only relative to their neighbors, two dimensions and three dimensions have similar behavior as the glass transition is approached, showing that the long-wavelength fluctuations do not cause a fundamental distinction between 2D and 3D glass transitions.},

Nonetheless, polymorphism, a favorite subject of Jack Dunitz, who is honored in this special issue, has opened a window into the forces that govern molecular organization in the solid state, while enabling discovery of new crystal forms with improved properties. This review illustrates the growth of crystals in nanoscale reactors with sizes comparable with those for nucleation, where thermodynamics and kinetics intersect, changing polymorph stabilities, providing insights into nucleation, enabling discovery of new polymorphs, and even suggesting a route to disappearing polymorphs, brought to our attention by Dunitz and Bernstein twenty years ago.},

abstract = {Hyperuniform many particle systems in d-dimensional space, which includes crystals, quasicrystals, and some exotic disordered systems, are characterized by an anomalous suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales such that the local number variance within a "spherical" observation window grows slower than the window volume. In usual circumstances, this direct space condition is equivalent to the Fourier space hyperuniformity condition that the structure factor vanishes as the wavenumber goes to zero. In this paper, we comprehensively study the effect of aspherical window shapes with characteristic size {\$}L{\$} on the direct space condition for hyperuniform systems. For lattices, we demonstrate that the variance growth rate can depend on the shape as well as the orientation of the windows, and in some cases, the growth rate can be faster than the window volume ({\$}L{\^{}}d{\$}), which may lead one to falsely conclude that the system is non-hyperuniform solely according to the direct space condition. We analyze the effect of window orientation on the growth rate, especially for two-dimensional lattices using square windows. Based on this analysis, we explain the reason why the variance can grow faster than the window area ({\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}) or even slower than the window perimeter ({\$}L{\$}). This analysis demonstrates an example of physical systems exhibiting commensurate-incommensurate transitions and is closely related to problems in number theory (e.g., Diophantine approximation and Gauss' circle problem) and discrepancy theory. We prove that for a hyperuniform system its orientationally-averaged variance, instead of the conventional one using windows with a fixed orientation, has a common large-{\$}L{\$} asymptotic behavior regardless of the window shape (for convex windows), thus it can be used to resolve the window-shape dependence of the growth rate of the variance on the spherical-window condition.},

(1.468(7) and 1.487(5)angstrom) provide unambiguous evidence for a
-agostic interaction. An inverse equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) for
ligand coordination upon cleavage of the agostic bond highlights the
weaker bond strength of Ni-H relative to the C-H bond. An Eyring plot
for -hydride elimination-olefin rotation-reinsertion is constructed from
variable-temperature NMR spectra with C-13-labeled agostic complexes.
The enthalpy of activation (H) for -H elimination is 13.2kcalmol(-1).
These results offer important mechanistic insight into two critical
steps in polymerization: ligand association upon cleavage of the
-agostic bonds and chain-migration via beta-H elimination.},

investigated by performing triaxial compression tests on air-dried sand

compression at various constant strain rates to investigate the rate

as well as type of sand on the mechanical behavior of granular

different rate dependency in terms of stiffness and peak normal stress.
In general, strain rate effects are highly dependent on confining stress

employed confining stress exhibiting the most pronounced effects to
variation in strain rates. Calcareous sand also exhibited a higher

abstract = {A challenge for particle assembly is to bring different colloids together in a controlled and uniform way that goes beyond making lattice structures. Ben Zion et al. used DNA origami to pattern colloidal particles and assemble them into clusters with controlled chirality and composition. DNA belts wrapped flat along the curvature of a colloidal particle in an L-like shape. This meant that other achiral colloidal particles, each furnished with a specific complementary DNA belt, could only attach in one orientation.Science, this issue p. 633Although stereochemistry has been a central focus of the molecular sciences since Pasteur, its province has previously been restricted to the nanometric scale. We have programmed the self-assembly of micron-sized colloidal clusters with structural information stemming from a nanometric arrangement. This was done by combining DNA nanotechnology with colloidal science. Using the functional flexibility of DNA origami in conjunction with the structural rigidity of colloidal particles, we demonstrate the parallel self-assembly of three-dimensional microconstructs, evincing highly specific geometry that includes control over position, dihedral angles, and cluster chirality.},

abstract = {Freezing and melting of ice are one of the most common events on Earth. The dynamics of ice crystallization are relevant to climate research, mitigating frost damage in agriculture and construction, glacier dynamics, tissue and food preservation, and transportation. We describe the use of microfluidic devices, accompanied by precise temperature control, to examine the effect of H/D isotope exchange between liquid light water and solid heavy water on ice growth dynamics. These studies revealed unusual morphologies at the ice surface in contact with the liquid, including curious unsteady morphological features that give the appearance of oscillation due to complex interplay of H/D exchange, thermal gradients, and local surface curvature.The growth dynamics of D2O ice in liquid H2O in a microfluidic device were investigated between the melting points of D2O ice (3.8 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C) and H2O ice (0 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C). As the temperature was decreased at rates between 0.002 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C/s and 0.1 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C/s, the ice front advanced but retreated immediately upon cessation of cooling, regardless of the temperature. This is a consequence of the competition between diffusion of H2O into the D2O ice, which favors melting of the interface, and the driving force for growth supplied by cooling. Raman microscopy tracked H/D exchange across the solid H2O{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}solid D2O interface, with diffusion coefficients consistent with transport of intact H2O molecules at the D2O ice interface. At fixed temperatures below 3 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C, the D2O ice front melted continuously, but at temperatures near 0 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C a scalloped interface morphology appeared with convex and concave sections that cycled between growth and retreat. This behavior, not observed for D2O ice in contact with D2O liquid or H2O ice in contact with H2O liquid, reflects a complex set of cooperative phenomena, including H/D exchange across the solid{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}liquid interface, latent heat exchange, local thermal gradients, and the Gibbs{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}Thomson effect on the melting points of the convex and concave features.},

Compared with reference Gd(2)O(3) and contrast agent Gadodiamide, the features in the RIXS spectra of all metallofullerenes exhibit broader spectral lineshape and noticeable energy shift. Using atomic multiplet calculations, we have estimated the key energy scales such as the inter-site spin exchange field, intra-atomic 4f–4f Coulomb interactions, and spin-orbit coupling.

To visualize the effect of the magnetoelectric tensor on polarimetric measurements, reported here are experimental mappings of the Mueller matrix and of the CB in a new chiral crystal with accidental null LB at an accessible optical frequency.

abstract = {While the equilibrium properties, states, and phase transitions of interacting systems are well described by statistical mechanics, the lack of suitable state parameters has hindered the understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena in divers settings, from glasses to driven systems to biology. Here we introduce a simple idea enabling the quantification of organiza-tion in non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, even when the form of order is unknown. The length of a losslessly compressed data file is a direct measure of its information content. Here we use data compression to study several out-of-equilibrium systems, and show that it both identifies ordering and reveals critical behavior in dynamical phase transitions. Our technique should provide a quantitative measure of organization in systems ranging from condensed matter systems in and out of equilibrium, to cosmology, biology and possibly economic and social systems. It seems clear that the shorter the description required to specify the state of a physical system, the more ordered the state is. This motivates the definition of the Kolmogorov complexity[1] K , which (loosely speaking) is the length of the shortest computer program required to generate a given data string. Although elegant, the Kolmogorov complexity is not typically computable or measurable, and so can not be used for physical systems. Thus, for practical purposes we will study an easily measured quantity, proportional to the length of a losslessly compressed data string, which we will refer to as " computable information density " (CID), which is also known to be an upper bound on both K and Shannon entropy[2] H. The fact that H reduces to ordinary thermodynamic entropy for systems in equilibrium provides a way to assess how well the CID approximates H, and indeed, studies of the 2D Ising model[3] reveal excellent agreement[4]. Here we explore the extent to which we can operationally define and use CID in systems where the nature of ordering is unclear. To this end, we study several different non-equilibrium systems, both on and off lattice, in one and two dimensions[5]. We show that lossless data compression provides an easily applied measure of information content which can serve as a simple and sensitive way to quantify order, its evolution in time, and its dependence on control parameters. To illustrate these ideas, we consider a particularly simple model with a non-equilibrium phase},

This formulation is shown to facilitate the analysis of the convergence properties of parallel temper-ing by large deviation theory, which indicates that the method should be operated in the infinite swapping limit to maximize sampling efficiency. The effective equation for the replica alone that arises in this infinite swapping limit simply involves replacing the original potential by a mixture potential. The analysis of the geometric properties of this potential offers a new perspective on the issues of how to choose of temperature ladder, and why many temperatures should typically be in-troduced to boost the sampling efficiency. It is also shown how to simulate the effective equation in this many temperature regime using multiscale integrators. Finally, similar ideas are also used to discuss extensions of the infinite swapping limits to the technique of simulated tempering.},

Computations based on an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction revealed that Forms?I and II are among the four lowest energy crystal structures of fifty calculated. A preliminary study of the contact insecticidal activity toward fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) indicates that Form II is more active, suggesting opportunities for more effective solid?state formulations that would allow reduced amounts of DDT, thereby minimizing environmental impact.},

They bear important features such as bioavailability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability with low toxicity serving as a platform for delivery of various small molecule therapeutics, gene therapies, protein biologics and cells. Depending on size and characteristic of the therapeutic, a variety of natural and engineered proteins or peptides have been developed. This, coupled to recent advances in synthetic and chemical biology, has led to the creation of tailor-made protein materials for delivery. This review highlights strategies employing proteins to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic matter, addressing the challenges for small molecule, gene, protein and cell transport. },

abstract = {Particles in sheared suspensions rearrange due to collisions, until they find positions where they no longer collide. At this point, the system stops evolving. Above a critical density/strain, they can no longer find such an absorbing state, and activity never ceases. At this critical point, the systems are hyperuniform, with number fluctuations in a volume of size ld scaling as {\textless}$\delta$N2{\textgreater}{\~{}}l$\lambda$,$\lambda${\textless}d, slower than random (diffusive), where {\textless}$\delta$N2{\textgreater}{\~{}}ld. Does hyperuniformity survive noise and thermal diffusion? We find that noise enhances the hyperuniformity toward the most uniform, {\textless}$\delta$N2{\textgreater}{\~{}}ld-1 near that of crystals. Practically, this provides a simple means of fabricating noncrystalline materials of arbitrary density and high homogeneity.Diffusion relaxes density fluctuations toward a uniform random state whose variance in regions of volume v=ld scales as $\sigma$$\rho$2=⟨$\rho$2(l)⟩-⟨$\rho$⟩2{\~{}}l-d. Systems whose fluctuations decay faster, $\sigma$$\rho$2{\~{}}l-$\lambda$ with d{\textless}$\lambda${\textless}=d+1, are called hyperuniform. The larger $\lambda$, the more uniform, with systems like crystals achieving the maximum value: $\lambda$=d+1. Although finite temperature equilibrium dynamics will not yield hyperuniform states, driven, nonequilibrium dynamics may. Such is the case, for example, in a simple model where overlapping particles are each given a small random displacement. Above a critical particle density $\rho$c, the system evolves forever, never finding a configuration where no particles overlap. Below $\rho$c, however, it eventually finds such a state, and stops evolving. This {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}absorbing state{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} is hyperuniform up to a length scale $\xi$, which diverges at $\rho$c. An important question is whether hyperuniformity survives noise and thermal fluctuations. We find that hyperuniformity of the absorbing state is not only robust against noise, diffusion, or activity, but that such perturbations reduce fluctuations toward their limiting behavior, $\lambda${\{}$\backslash$textrightarrow{\}}d+1, a uniformity similar to random close packing and early universe fluctuations, but with arbitrary controllable density.},

We develop a mathematical connection between the local density of OUPs and the statistics of their propulsion force, demonstrating the existence of an equation of state in one dimension, and its absence in higher dimensions. These insights are combined with a simplified far-from-equilibrium model to account for OUP behaviour in the vicinity of potentials.

abstract = {Disordered many-particle hyperuniform systems are exotic amorphous states of matter that lie between crystals and liquids. Hyperuniform systems have attracted recent attention because they are endowed with novel transport and optical properties. Recently, the hyperuniformity concept has been generalized to characterize two-phase media, scalar fields and random vector fields. In this paper, we devise methods to explicitly construct hyperuniform scalar fields. Specifically, we analyze spatial patterns generated from Gaussian random fields, which have been used to model the microwave background radiation and hetero-geneous materials, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for spinodal decomposition, and Swift-Hohenberg equations that have been used to model emergent pattern formation, including Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection. We show that the Gaussian random scalar fields can be constructed to be hyperuniform. We also numerically study the time evolution of spinodal decomposition patterns and demonstrate that they are hyperuniform in the scaling regime. Moreover, we find that labyrinth-like patterns generated by the Swift-Hohenberg equation are effectively hyperuniform. We show that thresholding (level-cutting) a hyperuniform Gaussian random field to produce a two-phase random medium tends to destroy the hyperuniformity of the progenitor scalar field. We then propose guidelines to achieve effectively hyperuniform two-phase media derived from thresh-olded non-Gaussian fields. Our investigation paves the way for new research directions to characterize the large-structure spatial patterns that arise in physics, chemistry, biology and ecology. Moreover, our theoretical results are expected to guide experimentalists to synthesize new classes of hyperuniform mate-rials with novel physical properties via coarsening processes and using state-of-the-art techniques, such as stereolithography and 3D printing.},

Our model, consisting of two continuous lines of rotlets, exhibits a linear instability driven only by hydrodynamic interactions, and reproduces the lengthscale selection observed in large scale particle simulations and in experiments. By adjusting only one parameter, the distance between the two lines, our dispersion relation exhibits quantitative agreement with the simulations and qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. Our linear stability analysis indicates that this instability is caused by the combination of the advective and transverse flows generated by the microrollers near a no-slip surface. Our simple model offers an interesting formalism to characterize other hydrodynamic instabilities that have not been yet well understood, such as size scale selection in suspensions of particles sedimenting adjacent to a wall, or the recently observed formations of traveling phonons in systems of confined driven particles.},

abstract = {The swimming direction of biological or artificial microscale swimmers tends to be randomised over long time-scales by thermal fluctuations. Bacteria use various strategies to bias swimming behaviour and achieve directed motion against a flow, maintain alignment with gravity or travel up a chemical gradient. Herein, we explore a purely geometric means of biasing the motion of artificial nanorod swimmers. These artificial swimmers are bimetallic rods, powered by a chemical fuel, which swim on a substrate printed with teardrop-shaped posts. The artificial swimmers are hydrodynamically attracted to the posts, swimming alongside the post perimeter for long times before leaving. The rods experience a higher rate of departure from the higher curvature end of the teardrop shape, thereby introducing a bias into their motion. This bias increases with swimming speed and can be translated into a macroscopic directional motion over long times by using arrays of teardrop-shaped posts aligned along a single direction. This method provides a protocol for concentrating swimmers, sorting swimmers according to different speeds, and could enable artificial swimmers to transport cargo to desired locations.},

The rogue wave precursors in these pockets are wave patterns of regular height but with a very specific shape that is identified explicitly, thereby allowing for early detection.

abstract = {Microscopic swimming particles, which dissipate energy to execute persistent directed motion, are a classic example of a non-equilibrium system. We investigate the non-interacting Ornstein– Uhlenbeck Particle (OUP), which is propelled through a viscous medium by a force which is cor-related over a finite time. We obtain an exact expression for the steady state phase-space density of a single OUP confined by a quadratic potential, and use the result to explore more complex ge-ometries, both through analytical approximations and numerical simulations. In a " Casimir " -style setup involving two narrowly-spaced walls, we describe a particle-trapping phenomenon, which leads to a repulsive effective interaction between the walls; while in a two-dimensional annulus geometry, we observe net stresses which resemble the Laplace pressure. Introduction. Recent investigation of " swimming " particles has provided many new insights into non-equilibrium phenomena. These swimmers exhibit a per-sistent Brownian motion, which violates detailed balance and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and results in a range of behaviours not observed in passive systems [1–5]. An " Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Particle " (OUP) swimmer is driven by a combination of a memory-less friction, and an exponentially correlated propulsion force with finite correlation time $\tau$ . This model has received significant attention, and some approximate methods have been pro-posed to study their steady state densities, such as the " Unified Coloured Noise Approximation " [6, 7] or per-turbative expansions close to equilibrium [8, 9]. In this paper we start with a simple exactly solv-able model of an OUP confined in a one dimensional harmonic potential, and discuss the crossover from an energy-equipartition dominated regime close to equilib-rium, to a force-balance dominated regime far from equi-librium. We use the results to interpret simulation data on more subtle OUP interactions with external poten-tials, including flows generated by asymmetric potentials, attractive and repulsive Casimir forces and Laplace-like pressure on a curved surface. Consider an OUP moving under an external force f (x) arising from a potential U (x), f = −∇U . In one dimen-sion (easily generalised to higher dimensions), the mi-croscopic equation of motion for the OUP's coordinate x(t) is the Langevin equation in which the propulsion force $\eta$(t) plays the role of a coloured noise and has ex-ponential correlations with a finite relaxation time $\tau$ . To treat this problem, we imagine that fluctuations of $\eta$(t) itself are governed by a hidden white noise variable $\xi$(t), such that the system as a whole is described by coupled Langevin equations:},

In the first model, discrimination between particle types is passive and sorting is driven, while the second model is based on an active proofreading network.

We present the theory of operation of vTOPSS, develop analytic models of its performance metrics, elucidate performance scaling with dimensions and voltage, and benchmark vTOPSS against existing spin-based and CMOS devices. Compared to existing spin-based devices, such as all-spin logic and charge-spin logic, vTOPSS offers 100× lower energy dissipation and (40-100)× lower energy-delay product. With experimental advances and improved material properties, we show that the energy-delay product of vTOPSS can be lowered to 10 −29 Js, competitive against existing CMOS technology. Finally, we establish that interconnect issues that dominate the per-formance in CMOS logic are relatively less significant for vTOPSS, implying that highly resistive materials can indeed be used to interconnect vTOPSS devices.},

abstract = {Consider electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional honeycomb structured media, whose constitutive laws have the symmetries of a hexagonal tiling of the plane. The properties of transverse electric (TE) polarized waves are determined by the spectral properties of the elliptic operator L A = −∇ x {\textperiodcentered} A(x)∇ x , where A(x) is $\Lambda$ h − periodic ($\Lambda$ h denotes the equilateral triangular lattice), and such that with respect to some origin of coordinates, A(x) is inversion symmetric (A(x) = A(−x)) and 120 • rotationally invariant (A(R * x) = R * A(x)R, where R is a 120 • rotation in the plane). A summary of our results is as follows: a) For generic honeycomb structured media, the band structure of L A has Dirac points, i.e. conical intersections between two adjacent Floquet-Bloch dispersion surfaces. b) Initial data of wave-packet type, which are spectrally concentrated about a Dirac point, give rise to solutions of the time-dependent Maxwell equations whose wave-envelope, on long time scales, is governed by an effective two-dimensional massless time-dependent system of Dirac equations. c) Dirac points are unstable to arbitrary small perturbations which break either C (complex-conjugation) symmetry or P (inver-sion) symmetry. d) The introduction through small and slow variations of a domain wall across a line-defect gives rise to the bifurcation from Dirac points of highly robust (topologically protected) edge states. These are time-harmonic solutions of Maxwell's equations which are propagating parallel to the line-defect and spatially localized trans-verse to it. The transverse localization and strong robustness to perturbation of these edge states is rooted in the protected zero mode of a one-dimensional effective Dirac operator with spatially varying mass term. e) These results imply the existence of uni-directional propagating edge states for two classes of time-reversal invariant media in which C symmetry is broken: magneto-optic media and bi-anisotropic media. Our anal-ysis applies and extends the tools previously developed in the context of honeycomb Schr{\"{o}}dinger operators.},
